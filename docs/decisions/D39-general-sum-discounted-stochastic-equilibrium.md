# D39: general-sum discounted stochastic equilibrium stays in Analysis

- **Status:** adopted and promoted
- **Date:** 2026-08-09
- **Experiment IDs:** EXP-072

## Decision / question

Whether the updated sibling repository's finite general-sum Fink theorem can
be recovered over the successor library's stochastic carrier, probability
law, equilibrium predicate, and fixed-point boundary without importing its
legacy stochastic closure.

## Competing designs

1. Adapt the finite-dimensional Fink map to canonical `FinDist`,
   `UtilityGame`, mixed Nash, and the existing one-way Analysis root.
2. Extract or import the sibling's `PMF`/kernel-game/simplex hierarchy.
3. Store discount and finite capabilities in `Stochastic.Game`.
4. Keep general-sum discounted existence in Frontier and recover only the
   independent uniform-payoff perturbation lemmas.

Design 1 is adopted.  Designs 2 and 3 duplicate or reverse accepted owners.
Design 4 remains the fallback for infinite-play and uniform-existence work,
but the finite discounted theorem itself no longer needs that deferral.

## Representative hostile slice

The general theorem uses finitely many states, players, and actions, bounded
stage utilities, and a normalized discount in `[0, 1]`.  It produces a
state-dependent `FinDist` action profile and continuation values such that:

1. the profile is canonical mixed Nash in every statewise auxiliary
   `UtilityGame`; and
2. the auxiliary expected utilities equal the continuation values.

The witness has two states, two players, two actions each, state-dependent
general-sum utilities, and action-dependent mixtures that put positive mass on
both next states.  At discount `1/2`, it invokes the general fixed-point
theorem rather than a hand-solved certificate.

## Measurements

| Measure | Result |
|---|---|
| sibling source | commit `da076851bab19519521aa1e0d2da127e29fcd5c9`; focused stochastic build green on Lean 4.32.0 but not accepted as release evidence |
| successor toolchain | Lean and Mathlib 4.32.2 |
| direct game imports | `Analysis.Nash`, `Core.MixedImprovement`, `Stochastic.Basic` |
| fixed-point dependency | reached transitively through the sole `Analysis.Nash` package import; no second direct package importer |
| probability and equilibrium owners | `FinDist`; canonical `IsNash` on `UtilityGame.mixed` |
| reusable extracted mathematics | one finite positive-part fixed-point theorem in `GameTheory.Math` |
| focused promoted build | `Analysis.Stochastic.Fink`, root, and hostile example: 3,115 jobs, warning-clean |
| source hazards | zero raw `Function.update`, `PMF`/`toPMF`, transports, `Fintype.ofFinite`, placeholders, or custom axioms |
| headline axiom profile | `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound` only |
| full architecture audit | `VERIFIED=1`; stable Stochastic 7 inputs reached/4 boundaries rejected, Analysis.Stochastic 11 inputs reached/2 boundaries rejected, exactly one fixed-point importer |
| default build | 3,525 jobs, warning-clean |

The sibling's 1,443-line proof depends directly on four legacy roots.  The
successor proof instead represents stationary choices by the existing product
of standard simplices, represents statewise auxiliary play as an ordinary
`UtilityGame`, and uses the existing payoff polynomial for continuity.  The
only general lemma missing from current owners was the positive-part algebra
that turns a Nash adjustment fixed point plus zero weighted gain into
nonpositive gains.

## Kill condition

Reject promotion if the theorem requires changing the stable stochastic
carrier, storing discount or finiteness, adding a second probability,
equilibrium, or fixed-point stack, importing infinite-path measure theory,
using raw profile updates or user-visible transports, depending on Lean 4.32.0
behavior, or broadening stable imports into Analysis.

No kill condition fired.  Finiteness and boundedness remain theorem-local, and
the stable `GameTheory.Stochastic` root cannot reach the new certificate or
existence theorem.

## Result and consequences

`GameTheory.Analysis.Stochastic.Fink` owns the general-sum discounted
stationary Bellman certificate and existence theorem.  The certificate is not
a parallel equilibrium predicate: its strategic half is canonical mixed Nash
in each auxiliary finite game.  `GameTheory.Math.PositivePartFixedPoint` owns
the independently reusable algebraic lemma.  The analytic stochastic root
exports Fink and Shapley side by side; the stable stochastic root remains
topology-free.

This result does not prove optimality against arbitrary infinite-history
strategies and does not prove uniform-equilibrium existence.  Those questions
retain their separate infinite-play and vanishing-discount gates.
