# D22: stochastic games are native data with a named Protocol bridge

- **Status:** adopted and promoted
- **Date:** 2026-08-02
- **Experiment IDs:** EXP-050; follow-up gates EXP-108 (in progress),
  EXP-116 (complete; bounded Kuhn specialization), and EXP-117 (complete;
  infinite-product policy law), EXP-118 (complete; reverse arbitrary-policy-law
  conditioning)

## Decision / question

Where finite-support stochastic-game data, finite-horizon behavioral play, and
uniform equilibrium belong relative to the accepted finite-law, static
equilibrium, Protocol, Repeated, and Analysis boundaries.

The source evidence is the active sibling repository `D:/workspace/GameTheory`
on branch `uniform-existence`, audited at `e7730a1`. Its four relevant files
were unchanged from the initially observed `d35c1d8` through that revision.
The sibling is not imported and is not a dependency.

A read-only follow-up on 2026-08-02 inspected the branch at
`81f4a98af8f9eb05c3c13d0657e81505b24e5487`.  The branch had grown to 52
stochastic files and roughly 34.6k added lines, but its smallest portable spine
remained the native stochastic-game data, finite-horizon behavioral semantics,
and uniform predicates already represented by this decision.  The general
uniform-existence constructor still contains a placeholder and remains
excluded with its dependent research hierarchy.

A second read-only follow-up on 2026-08-03 inspected the moving branch at
`dba3b7a1356581d676d0f432bd1cb39ade41afb5`.  The named deviation-cap
constructor and its exact equivalence with uniform-equilibrium payoff entered
at `81c60ec813348b9805b3ae26b96a3b767b9e05f9`; that source file is unchanged
between that revision and the audited head.  Only its placeholder-independent
certificate calculus is adapted here.  Its general existence constructor still
contains `sorry`, so the existence theorem and every dependent claim remain
absent.

## Competing designs

1. Store native state/action/transition/utility data and expose a named bridge
   to the canonical Protocol execution, information, and behavioral runner.
2. Define a stochastic game as a transparent specialization carrying an
   `ExecutionProtocol` and information model.
3. Treat a stochastic game as a repeated-game extension.
4. Retain the source branch's `PMF`, independent finite-history runner,
   `KernelGame` horizon wrapper, stored discount, and raw profile updates.

Design 1 is adopted. A stochastic transition kernel is meaningful without an
initial state or information model, so design 2 stores downstream choices too
early. Stochastic state evolution is not repetition of a fixed stage game, so
design 3 forgets native data. Design 4 duplicates accepted probability,
Protocol, and equilibrium semantics.

## Representative hostile slice

Two Boolean players act simultaneously in two public states. Agreement flips
the state deterministically; disagreement reaches both states with positive
probability; stage utility depends on the current state and the player's
action. A fixed initial state compiles to a nonterminating all-active
`ExecutionProtocol` with perfect public monitoring.

One Protocol behavioral profile feeds every finite horizon. The horizon form
is exactly `InformationModel.toBehavioralGameForm`; expected average payoff is
ordinary `expectedUtility`; epsilon-horizon Nash is an abbreviation of the
canonical `IsεNash`; and uniformity adds only the quantifier over all horizons
past one threshold. Horizon zero has the explicit empty-average value zero.

The first experimental presentation exposed Protocol's proof-carrying
`StepEvent` as the policy information state. The audit rejected that public
shape. The promoted bridge maps each event to a proof-free `StageRecord` and
proves source, target, and every pure joint-action coordinate are retained.
Only proposition-valued legality and support evidence remains internal to
Protocol.

## Kill condition

Reject the design if the hostile slice needs `PMF` or a law on infinite paths,
duplicates the Protocol history runner or behavioral-policy type, defines a
second equilibrium predicate, stores discount or finiteness irrelevant to the
native data, requires raw `Function.update` or user-visible transport, imports
the source conjecture, or leaks Analysis/Repeated dependencies into the new
root.

No kill condition fired. The proof-carrying information-state pressure
narrowed the bridge before promotion rather than changing the native object.

## Result

`GameTheory.Stochastic.Basic` owns the native game and proof-free public stage
records. `Stochastic.PerfectMonitoring` supplies the selected-initial-state
Protocol execution and information model. `Stochastic.FiniteHorizon` owns the
average-payoff evaluation of the canonical history law. `Stochastic.Uniform`
owns transparent horizon and uniform solution concepts through
`Core.Approximate`. Its post-gate proof surface also exposes finite-horizon
epsilon monotonicity and `HasUniformDeviationCapConstructor`: for every positive
accuracy, one eventual profile is close to a proposed value and caps every
unilateral deviation. Applying the certificate at half accuracy is exactly
equivalent to `IsUniformEquilibriumPayoff`; this is a checked construction
waist, not an existence assertion.

EXP-116 adds `Stochastic.Kuhn` at the same bridge boundary. Perfect monitoring
has perfect recall, and a fully supported finite-action behavioral run exposes
a finite set of all counterfactually reachable public-history sites through a
fixed horizon. Generic Protocol finite-site predrawing then yields exact
whole-profile, unilateral updated-law, and Nash transfers between proof-free
behavioral and mixed public policies without finite states or a
`Fintype PublicHistory` assumption. This adds neither a runner nor an
equilibrium predicate.

EXP-117/D57 closes that separately gated forward policy-measure claim without
changing the stochastic carrier. Mathlib's ordinary infinite product gives
one ex-ante probability law over total pure Protocol policies, independent of
horizon. Its finite marginals are the EXP-116 predraws, so the sole Protocol
runner yields every finite-prefix law and the corresponding law after an
arbitrary behavioral unilateral replacement. Countable states and finite
actions give regularity; bounded stage utility and a discount in `[0, 1)` give
summability and normalized discounted-payoff equality. This is not the
EXP-108 infinite-play outcome measure and adds no equilibrium predicate.

EXP-118/D58 closes the reverse gate at the same boundary. Independent
arbitrary probability measures over total pure Protocol policies are
conditioned only on finite measurable own-record cylinders, yielding one
behavioral profile before the horizon quantifier. Perfect monitoring supplies
perfect recall; the existing bounded cover and runner give all finite-prefix,
unilateral replacement, and bounded discounted stochastic corollaries. The
generic result does not require regularity, and it does not represent a
correlated joint player law or define an infinite-path outcome measure.

The umbrella `GameTheory.Stochastic` is public and opt-in. At this decision it
remained provisional until the Shapley gate; EXP-051/D23 subsequently closed
that gate through a one-way normalized Analysis bridge. The main `GameTheory` root does not
import it. Positive probes ensure the umbrella
reaches all four layers and canonical approximate Nash; negative probes reject
Repeated theory and the fixed-point dependency.

## Consequences and scope

This decision ports the source branch's basic semantic waist, not its research
claim. There is no theorem asserting general uniform-equilibrium-payoff
existence and no placeholder standing in for it. Future known-case existence
theorems belong above this root, with Analysis used only when their proof
actually needs it.

The adopted data/bridge API is stable. D23 subsequently proved the mature
finite discounted two-player zero-sum slice: its normalized operator is a
contraction with a unique value and stationary statewise saddle selectors, so
the finite stochastic domain is now broadly supported. Uniform equilibrium now has a trustworthy
statement layer on which known special cases or research-facing certificates
can land without weakening mature foundations.

Promotion passed the Phase 0, 1, 2, and 3 expected-value audits, the exact
coverage audit, the full build, and the flagship axiom audit. Phase 2 reports
zero stochastic transport or forbidden imports and no unbucketed files.
