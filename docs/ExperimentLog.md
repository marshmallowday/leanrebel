# Architecture experiment log

This is the lightweight evidence ledger for the rewrite. The RFC states the
current design; this file preserves what was actually tried and observed.

Use one entry per experiment. Keep it roughly 5–15 lines and link to code,
decision records, or bulky output. Start with one file; split it only when it
becomes difficult to scan.

- **Decision / question:** D?, and the claim being tested
- **Representative slice:** the smallest hostile example used
- **Evidence:** exact files, commands, measurements, or linked logs
- **Observation:** what happened, including unexpected behavior
- **Outcome:** supports / refutes / narrows / inconclusive

Add the corresponding one-line index row when completing the entry. Preserve
failed and inconclusive runs; a later experiment may supersede their conclusion
but should not erase their evidence.

### EXP-001: Semantic architecture baseline and scope inventory

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-22, initial uncommitted repository scaffold
- **Decision / question:** D0 and Phase 0; whether the measured dependency evidence supports a universal hub, coordinated branches, or a stratified hybrid at each semantic level
- **Representative slice:** four named cross-representation transfers, a frozen cross-domain flagship list, and one concrete probe for every proposed domain
- **Evidence:** measurements and direct baselines recorded in [`Phase0ArchitectureEvidence.md`](Phase0ArchitectureEvidence.md)
- **Observation:** the complete snapshot is 436 Lean files/117,094 nonblank lines; its `GameTheory/` corpus is 380/99,301 and `Math/` is 56/17,793. Authored text in 187/380 `GameTheory/` files mentions the utility-bearing hub, including 47 language files. There are 6,243 nonblank bridge lines and 84 code-level language `cast`/`Eq.ndrec` tokens after comments and strings are stripped. Generic transport has no language-level `Transport.comp` consumer. Kuhn mixed-to-behavioral requires reach/support and posterior-locality facts beyond perfect recall. Historical change concentration is unmeasurable because the pinned archive has no git history.
- **Outcome:** narrows — share utility-free static forms and deviation logic; retain coordinated native protocol/information branches; withhold a generic certificate hierarchy pending Phase 3 composition and cost measurements
- **Next action:** run Phase 1's D1/D2 miniature competition under the explicit bridge/certificate budget in [`decisions/D0-semantic-architecture.md`](decisions/D0-semantic-architecture.md)

### EXP-002: Signature ownership miniature

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-22, Phase 1 working tree based on `e727659`
- **Decision / question:** D1; whether indexing forms by an external signature materially reduces transport burden relative to storing the same signature as a field
- **Representative slice:** two forms sharing one signature, unilateral update, player reindexing, outcome relabeling, product, mixed extension, and six heterogeneous form-hom compositions
- **Evidence:** `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/phase1-audit.ps1 -VerifyExpected -Time`; `lake build GameTheory.Experimental.Phase1.D1.Stress GameTheory.Experimental.Phase1.D2.Interop`; source under `GameTheory/Experimental/Phase1/D1/`
- **Observation:** the corrected regex includes `▸` and `Eq.rec`. Raw core counts are 2/2 indexed/bundled; subtracting each candidate's one allowed profile transport and adding its downstream stress namespace gives 1/3. Association proofs are 6/5 lines. The profiled six-composition declarations took 23.057/11.154 ms in one warm run. Indexed reuse takes `F G : Form sig` and one profile directly; bundled reuse needs a signature equality and two `▸` transports. The bundled form also has a higher, non-inferable universe boundary. Reindexed compiler adequacy is `rfl` for both. Because the explicit token baseline is below ten and indexed signatures did not materially reduce it, D1's rejection rule applies; its longer heterogeneous theorem signature is additional negative evidence.
- **Outcome:** narrows — provisionally select the bundled-signature form, with strategy and outcome still owned by the stored signature; do not freeze it before Phase 2 downstream usability tests
- **Next action:** use the provisional bundled form in Phase 2, then run the named transformation trial: nested operations, `e`/`e.symm` reindex round trip, and equivalence lifting through mixed extension

### EXP-003: Finite-law representation miniature

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-22, Phase 1 working tree based on `e727659`
- **Decision / question:** D2; whether a finite-support `PMF` subtype or normalized `Finsupp` gives the better semantic and Analysis boundary
- **Representative slice:** pure/map/bind/product and laws, real expectation and bind, support, dependent finite products, PMF conversion, a nontrivial finite-support law on `Nat`, and a finite-carrier `stdSimplex` round trip preserving pure/product/expectation/affine mixture
- **Evidence:** `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/phase1-audit.ps1 -VerifyExpected -Time`; `lake build GameTheory.Experimental.Phase1.D1.Stress GameTheory.Experimental.Phase1.D2.Interop`; source under `GameTheory/Experimental/Phase1/D2/`; candidate A includes the required operation and expectation proofs
- **Observation:** after review-strengthening, the PMF/Finsupp cores are 345/221 nonblank lines; their expectation-bind proofs are 52/19 lines and simplex equivalences 14/12. PMF uses 24 `toReal`, 41 `ENNReal`, 3 transport, and 5 classical/noncomputable tokens; Finsupp uses 0/1/4/8. The Finsupp candidate needs an additional 101-line PMF/dependent-product boundary (3 `toReal`, 3 `ENNReal`, 3 transport, 4 classical/noncomputable), and its dependent product routes through Candidate A rather than constituting an independent implementation. Both now exercise two-point support on `Nat`; Candidate A proves affine mixture and its simplex commutation. Exact current counts are asserted by the audit script.
- **Outcome:** narrows — neither representation dominates, so apply D2's stated fallback and choose a finite-support `PMF` subtype behind the future `FinDist` API
- **Next action:** Phase 2 uses only the chosen PMF-subtype representation; retain the Finsupp candidate solely as EXP-003 evidence

### EXP-004: Phase 1 gate review hardening

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-23, review amendment based on initial gate `4f308a0`
- **Decision / question:** D1/D2; whether the recorded transport comparison, universe evidence, finite-support hostility, and simplex preservation were strong enough to support the gate
- **Representative slice:** rerun D1 with `▸`/`Eq.rec` counted and the profile allowance isolated; enable universe lint outside declaration-local exceptions; add native two-point `Nat` laws; add PMF-law affine mixing with expectation and simplex commutation
- **Evidence:** `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/phase1-audit.ps1 -VerifyExpected -Time`; `lake build`; amended Phase 1 Lean files and D1/D2 records
- **Observation:** the original regex undercounted bundled downstream transport, changing the comparable D1 tally from the recorded 1/1 to 1/3. Bundled forms also pay a higher, non-inferable universe boundary. Candidate B's dependent product was confirmed to route through Candidate A rather than independently implement Finsupp products. The winning PMF law initially lacked affine preservation; `Law.mix`, `expect_mix`, and `simplexEquiv_mix_apply` now close that gap. A direct-elaboration failure in the first pure-vertex proof was exposed by the timed audit and fixed before the gate rerun.
- **Outcome:** narrows — neither decision flips, but D1 remains explicitly provisional and D2 now names its downstream kill tests; the original measurement defect is retained here rather than hidden
- **Next action:** begin Phase 2 depth-first with the bundled form and PMF-subtype law, reopening either decision immediately if the named transformation or semantic slices trigger a kill condition
- **2026-08-16 maintenance:** removing the declaration-local `set_option`
  wrappers and replacing them with explanatory comments changed only D1's
  nonblank-line measurements, from 95/99 to 96/101. Transport counts and every
  decision-bearing comparison are unchanged; the audit baseline and D1 record
  now reflect the current measured sources.

### EXP-005: One local deviation predicate for five equilibria

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-26, Phase 2 working tree based on `bc1135f`
- **Decision / question:** D5; whether a single `IsEquilibrium` built from a
  law-linear, information-local `DeviationScheme` expresses pure Nash, mixed
  Nash, CCE, CE, and strong Nash without duplicate logical definitions and
  without letting a deviating unit read nonmember recommendations
- **Representative slice:** the four schemes in `GameTheory/Core/Equilibrium.lean`
  (unilateral-constant, recommendation, unilateral-randomized, nonempty-coalition),
  their three scheme morphisms, and the hostile file `GameTheory/Tests/Locality.lean`
- **Evidence:** `lake build`;
  `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/phase2-audit.ps1 -VerifyExpected`;
  `GameTheory/Core/Deviation.lean`, `Equilibrium.lean`, `Response.lean`
- **Observation:** the audit finds exactly one `def` for each of
  `IsEquilibrium`, `IsNash`, `IsCoarseCorrelatedEq`, `IsCorrelatedEq`,
  `IsStrongNash`, `IsBestResponse`, `WeaklyDominates`, `StrictlyDominatesOn`,
  `IsDominant`, `IsRationalizable`, and `IsParetoEfficient`. Mixed Nash is
  `IsNash F.mixed` and gets no definition at all.
  `isNash_iff_isCoarseCorrelatedEq_pure` is `Iff.rfl`;
  `IsCorrelatedEq.isCoarseCorrelatedEq` is one application of
  `constantToRecommendation`; `IsStrongNash.isNash` is four lines through
  `constantToCoalition` plus preference weakening. Locality is stronger than a
  compile-failure test: `Subprofile.singletonEquiv` proves a unilateral
  deviation's argument type is equivalent to the deviator's own strategy, so a
  recommendation-spying CE deviation is inexpressible rather than merely
  rejected. Result locality is also proved: `exists_agree_off_members` shows
  every reachable deviated profile agrees with a status-quo profile off the
  member set. Law-linearity is structural: `apply` is the only place a
  deviation meets a law, and `apply_bind` holds for every scheme. Under
  expected utility, randomized deviations reduce to deterministic ones
  (`isCoarseCorrelatedEq_randomized`), which needed a finite-support Fubini
  lemma (`FinDist.expect_comm`). The profile-quantified family stayed separate
  and is linked to equilibrium by `IsNash.isRationalizable` and
  `isNash_iff_isBestResponse`, not by aliasing.
- **Outcome:** supports - D5 passes its Phase 2 gate; neither core-invalidating
  failure 9.1.1 nor 9.1.2 was triggered
- **Next action:** record [`decisions/D5-deviation-and-equilibrium.md`](decisions/D5-deviation-and-equilibrium.md);
  re-test the interface against sequential and assessment deviations in Phase 3

### EXP-006: Separated form, preference, and utility under the incentive slice

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-26, Phase 2 working tree based on `bc1135f`
- **Decision / question:** D4 and D9; whether utility-free forms plus explicit
  preferences avoid a recurring `IsNash_iff_IsNashFor_eu` rewrite pattern, and
  whether finiteness stays an independent per-theorem capability
- **Representative slice:** one `GameForm` used with expected-utility and with
  a purely ordinal preference; positive-affine invariance; outcome relabeling
  with utility pullback; the capability table in
  [`decisions/D9-finiteness-capabilities.md`](decisions/D9-finiteness-capabilities.md)
- **Evidence:** `GameTheory/Core/Preference.lean`, `GameTheory/Core/Utility.lean`;
  `GameTheory/Examples/Classic.lean`
  (`prisonersDilemma_bothDefect_isNash_ordinal`,
  `update_eq_self_serves_both_laws`);
  `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/phase2-audit.ps1`
- **Observation:** no `IsNash_iff_..._eu` theorem exists or is needed, because
  the preference is an argument rather than a second definition; the audit's
  duplicate-definition counter is 0. `euPreference_affine` and
  `isNash_mapOutcome` hold with no cast in either statement. The same
  Prisoner's Dilemma form is used with `euPreference` and with a
  non-expected-utility `bestCasePreference`, and one signature-bound profile
  plus one `Profile.update_eq_self` serves two different play laws. Finiteness
  stayed unbundled: the whole equilibrium family needs only `DecidableEq` on
  players, the mixed extension adds `Fintype` on players, and enumeration adds
  finite strategy carriers.
  Two negative findings. First, the D4 spike's proposed ordered-field
  factoring of finite-expectation lemmas earned nothing: the real side goes
  through `FinDist.expect` and the rational side through `Finset.sum` on an
  explicit table, no lemma was duplicated, and no scalar-polymorphic layer was
  added. Second, D1's bundled form needed `@[reducible]` on every signature and
  form transformer (`GameSignature.mapOutcome`, `GameSignature.mixed`,
  `GameForm.mapOutcome`, `GameForm.mixed`, `TableGame.toForm`,
  `BayesianGame.toForm`); without it `F.mixed.sig` does not reduce to
  `F.sig.mixed` at `instances` transparency and `rw`/`simp` produce
  type-incorrect targets. `isNash_mapOutcome` still needs one `show` to restate
  its goal at the transparent type. This cost did not appear in the Phase 1
  miniature.
  A third measurement concerns D12 rather than D4: Core's authored imports are
  clean, but Mathlib's `PMF` transitively imports `MeasureTheory.Measure.Dirac`
  and `Topology.Instances.ENNReal.Lemmas`, so `MeasureTheory.Measure` and
  `ContinuousMap` are reachable from `GameTheory.Core`. Narrowing `FinDist`'s
  import from `ProbabilityMassFunction.Constructions` to `.Monad` removed
  `stdSimplex` and `Polynomial` from that closure; the remainder is unavoidable
  for any real-valued core.
- **Outcome:** narrows - D4 and D9 are accepted as written, the ordered-field
  factoring is rejected, and D1's bundled form accumulates new negative evidence
- **Next action:** record D4, D9, and the D1 amendment; re-examine D1 at
  Phase 4's transformation trial before freezing it

### EXP-007: Executable rational frontend and its correctness boundary

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-26, Phase 2 working tree based on `bc1135f`
- **Decision / question:** D10; whether a rational finite-table frontend can be
  proved correct against the semantic Nash predicate without duplicating
  solution concepts, and whether its algorithm root stays free of real,
  topological, and noncomputable dependencies
- **Representative slice:** `TableGame` with pure-Nash verification and
  enumeration, weak and strict dominance, dominant profiles, Pareto efficiency,
  iterated strict dominance, and exact rational mixed verification; Prisoner's
  Dilemma, Matching Pennies, Battle of the Sexes, and a three-player unanimity
  game
- **Evidence:** `GameTheory/Finite/Algorithm.lean`,
  `GameTheory/Finite/Correctness.lean`, `GameTheory/Examples/Classic.lean`;
  `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/phase2-audit.ps1 -VerifyExpected`
- **Observation:** every algorithm has a proved equivalence with a Core
  predicate: `mem_enumerateNash_iff`, `weaklyDominates_eq_true_iff`,
  `strictlyDominates_eq_true_iff`, `isDominantProfile_eq_true_iff`,
  `isParetoEfficient_eq_true_iff`, `mem_survivors_iff`, and
  `verifyMixedNash_eq_true_iff`. The executable layer defines no solution
  concept. The dependency budget is checked empirically rather than by reading
  imports: six probe files assert that `GameTheory.Finite.Algorithm` cannot see
  `Real.instAdd`, `PMF`, `MeasureTheory.Measure`, or `stdSimplex`, and that
  `GameTheory.Core` cannot see `stdSimplex` or `Polynomial`. All six pass. The
  algorithm module contains no `open Classical`, `classical`, `noncomputable`,
  or `Fintype.ofFinite`; the game's own `Fintype` and `DecidableEq` fields are
  used throughout.
  One tooling limitation was discovered and is not a design failure: kernel
  `decide` cannot evaluate rational arithmetic, because `Rat.add` and
  `Rat.blt` do not reduce - `decide` gets stuck at `(1/2).blt 0`. Pure-Nash and
  dominance facts, which only compare literals, still decide. Rational
  arithmetic facts, meaning the mixed-profile checks, are therefore run by
  compiled evaluation (`#guard`, `#eval`) and proved by `norm_num` over an
  explicit profile enumeration (`pennyProfiles`, `sum_pennies`).
  `native_decide` is excluded by the trust rules and is not used anywhere.
- **Outcome:** supports - D10 passes, with the rational-kernel-reduction
  limitation recorded as a fact about the toolchain rather than about the
  representation
- **Next action:** record [`decisions/D10-executable-frontend.md`](decisions/D10-executable-frontend.md);
  revisit if a later slice needs large rational computations inside proofs

### EXP-008: Bayesian interim-deviation scope probe

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-26, Phase 2 working tree based on `bc1135f`
- **Decision / question:** Phase 0 flagship F5; whether an interim,
  type-dependent deviation is expressible through the shared local-deviation
  interface without exposing other players' types or recommendations, or
  whether Bayesian games need their own coordinated branch
- **Representative slice:** a finite common-prior Bayesian game compiled to a
  `GameForm` whose strategies are type-contingent plans, with a prior-weighted
  interim value taking only the deviator's own type and own action
- **Evidence:** `GameTheory/Experimental/Phase2/BayesianProbe.lean` (158
  nonblank lines), theorem `BayesianGame.isNash_iff_interim`
- **Observation:** ex-ante Bayes-Nash is `IsNash` of the compiled form under
  `euPreference`, with no new predicate, unlike the comparison design's `Iff.rfl` wrapper. The
  interim condition is not a renaming: `isNash_iff_interim` needs the prior to
  decompose over the deviator's own type (`prior_expect_eq_sum`) and needs an
  ex-ante deviation to be reconstructed from a single-type change, and it is
  proved in both directions. The argument list of `interimValue` is deviator,
  own type, status-quo plan, own action; no other player's type or
  recommendation is in scope. Using the prior-weighted value avoids any
  positive-probability side condition and keeps conditioning machinery out of
  Core.
- **Outcome:** supports - Bayesian games fit the shared static form and the
  local-deviation vocabulary at the ex-ante and interim level; no separate
  branch is needed for this slice
- **Next action:** keep the probe experimental; interim beliefs off the
  equilibrium path belong to the Phase 3 assessment slice, not to the static
  core

### EXP-009: Open games as a source of core abstractions

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-26, read-only comparison audit; no new Lean code
- **Decision / question:** D6 and D7; whether the open-game presentation hints
  at a better abstraction for the Phase 3 sequential interface, and whether its
  equilibrium-as-a-field is independent content or derivable from native
  semantics. Phase 0 had classified open games as a Frontier branch on the
  strength of the field alone; this audit tests that classification before
  Phase 3 fixes its information interface.
- **Representative slice:** `OpenGame/Syntax.lean` (the structure and
  combinators), `OpenGame/Compile.lean` (`ShapeN`, `ShapeS`),
  `OpenGame/Theorems.lean`, and `Bridges/OpenGame_EFG.lean`
- **Evidence:** the structure carries four fields, `Strategy`, `play`,
  `coplay : Strategy -> X -> R -> S`, and
  `IsEquilibriumIn : X -> (Y -> R) -> Strategy -> Prop`, with
  `Context X Y R := X x (Y -> R)`. Corpus sizes: about 8,000 nonblank lines of
  open-game material; `Bridges/OpenGame_MAID.lean` is 1,860 nonblank lines and
  holds 23 of the snapshot's 84 code-level transport tokens, the single worst
  concentration in the baseline; `Bridges/OpenGame_EFG.lean` is 506 nonblank lines for one
  two-stage example; `OpenGame/Theorems.lean` is 64 nonblank lines and contains
  no generic theorem about `OpenGame`.
- **Observation:** three separable findings.
  1. *The carried equilibrium is derivable, and it is subgame perfection rather
     than Nash.* `conditioned_isEquilibriumIn_iff_efg_isSubgamePerfectEq` proves
     both directions against the native EFG concept, and
     `conditioned_isEquilibriumIn_iff_hasNoOneShotDeviation` derives the
     one-shot-deviation form from `oneShotDeviation_iff_spe`, which is Phase 0's
     flagship F4. So the field is redundant with native sequential semantics for
     every compiled shape; quantifying over the continuation `k : Y -> R` is
     exactly what upgrades a static equilibrium to a sequential one.
     `Theorems.lean` states the same decomposition directly:
     `conditioned_iff_plain_and_offPath`.
  2. *Storing it is still wrong, and the baseline shows why.* Each constructor writes its
     own field: `ShapeN` hand-writes unilateral-deviation Nash with a raw
     `Function.update`, and `ShapeS` writes a different two-part condition. That
     is an additional duplicate public Nash surface, which RFC 9.1.1 forbids,
     and nothing prevents two components from composing while carrying
     inconsistent notions.
  3. *The co-outcome channel has no consumer.* Every concrete construction sets
     `coplay _ _ _ := ()`; the only nontrivial `coplay` definitions are the
     generic combinators in `Syntax.lean`, which thread the channel so that
     composition typechecks. No compiled game and no theorem reads it. The
     reserved kill condition for the lens presentation therefore fires.
- **Outcome:** narrows - reject the lens structure and the carried equilibrium;
  adopt the *context* idea as a Phase 3 design directive
- **Next action:** Phase 3 should shape its one-shot-deviation and sequential
  rationality interface as "profile plus continuation", with equilibrium derived
  from D5's deviation machinery and no co-outcome channel. Open games stay a
  Frontier branch under D12; this audit removes the temptation to promote them
  and replaces it with the one idea that measured well.

### EXP-010: General-state execution, terminal play, and chance

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-27, Phase 3 working tree based on the Phase 2 gate
- **Decision / question:** D6; whether a general-state `ExecutionProtocol` can
  give usable terminal, chance, and run semantics. RFC 9.1.6 makes it a
  core-invalidating failure if the selected execution semantics needs an
  impossible total legal-action chooser at terminal states, dummy probability
  data at chance nodes, or evaluation that silently stops at a chance node.
- **Representative slice:** `coinThenMove` in `GameTheory/Tests/Execution.lean` -
  a fair chance node with no mover, followed by a one-player decision, followed
  by a terminal state, so all three failure modes are reachable in one protocol
- **Evidence:** `GameTheory/Protocol/Execution.lean` and
  `GameTheory/Tests/Execution.lean`; `lake build`
- **Observation:** none of the three failure modes occurred.
  1. *No total chooser.* `Chooser` takes a non-terminality proof, so terminal
     states are never queried. Stronger, `terminal_no_legal` is a *theorem*
     rather than the assumed field of the RFC sketch: legality was defined as
     "not terminal, and every active player supplies an available action", so a
     total chooser could not be written even if a runner asked for one.
  2. *Chance is carried by the transition law.* `chanceLaw` is `step` applied to
     the no-op joint action at a state where nobody is active;
     `coinThenMove_chanceLaw_heads`, `..._tails`, and `..._normalized` show the
     law is a genuine fair coin, not dummy data hung on a `none` mover.
  3. *Evaluation does not stop at chance.* `runFor_succ_of_chance` proves the
     runner steps through a chance state, and `runFor_of_terminal` proves
     terminal states absorb. `runFor_one_from_chance` instantiates both.
  4. *The chosen action drives the run.* Review caught that the first version of
     the slice could not detect a runner that consulted the chooser and then
     discarded its answer - for instance one picking a legal action itself via
     `Classical.choice` on `exists_legal` - because `step` ignored the joint
     action outside the chance node. The protocol now splits its terminal state
     into `tookIt`/`leftIt` and lets `step` branch on the move, and
     `takePolicy_ne_leavePolicy` proves the two policies induce *different*
     two-step laws from the chance node (`prob_tookIt_take = 1` against
     `prob_tookIt_leave = 0`). Without that probe the other three tests were
     satisfiable by a runner that never used the chooser's choice.
  Two simplifications relative to the RFC sketch: legality became a definition
  rather than a stored field plus `legal_iff_active_available`, removing one
  field and one law; and `active` is proposition-valued rather than a `Finset`,
  keeping enumeration out of proof semantics (D9). `Trace` is `Type`-valued, so
  `IsTreeShaped := ∀ state, Subsingleton (Trace E state)` is a genuine
  uniqueness statement - the repair for the comparison design's `Subsingleton (Reachable s t)`,
  which was vacuous under proof irrelevance.
  One negative datapoint, and it is not about D6: the concrete protocol needed
  `@[reducible]`, because `coinThenMove.State` does not reduce to its carrier at
  `instances` transparency. This is the *third* module to need that annotation
  after `GameForm` and `TableGame`/`BayesianGame`. RFC 9.3 says an exception
  recurring across two or more modules is promoted to its design decision, so
  this is now formal evidence against D1's bundled-signature form rather than an
  isolated waiver.
- **Outcome:** supports - the general-state candidate survives RFC 9.1.6; the
  question of whether it *beats* finite-first is separate and is reserved as
  EXP-012
- **Next action:** build the finite-first candidate, encode the same
  perfect-information EFG with chance in both, and decide D6 on the measurement
### EXP-011: Information locality by construction

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-27, Phase 3 working tree
- **Decision / question:** D6; whether an information model layered over an
  execution protocol keeps strategies information-local *by typing* rather than
  by a later proposition. RFC 9.1.7 makes it a core-invalidating failure if the
  strategy type exposes hidden execution state, relies only on a subsequent
  locality proposition, or cannot support conditional beliefs and sequential
  rationality without reopening native information equivalence.
- **Representative slice:** `hiddenCard`, a two-seat imperfect-information
  protocol - nature deals `high`/`low`, the `informed` seat is told privately,
  the `blind` seat is not, both then call simultaneously
- **Evidence:** `GameTheory/Protocol/Information.lean`,
  `GameTheory/Tests/Information.lean`; `lake build`
- **Observation:** RFC 9.1.7 is **not** triggered.
  *Locality is typing, not a hypothesis.* `Policy i` is
  `(info : InfoState i) → { choice // choice ∈ menu i info }`. It has no
  `E.State` argument, which `blind_policy_type` records as an `rfl`-checked type
  equation. `blind_cannot_tell` proves the two dealt states give the blind seat
  equal `InfoState`, and `every_blind_policy_agrees` follows by `congrArg` -
  there is no locality hypothesis and no "assume the policy is constant on the
  information set" lemma anywhere.
  *The information state is history-indexed.* `infoOf` recurses over `Trace`
  rather than mapping states, so information accumulates along a run instead of
  being read off a state.
  *Menu adequacy did not need hidden state.* `menu : (i) → InfoState i → Set …`
  never receives a state; the adequacy *law* quantifies over states and traces,
  which is what a law is for. The payoff is `legalOption_of_mem_menu`: one
  information-local menu is the legal option set at every state in the
  information set, so `jointAt_legal` builds a legal joint action from a profile
  of information-local policies with no state-indexed menu and no native
  equivalence relation on states.
  *The probes have teeth.* `informed_can_tell` proves the *informed* seat's
  `InfoState` values at the same two states differ, which kills
  `InfoState := Unit` and every degenerate information state that would make the
  equalities above vacuous. `blindPolicy` inhabits the policy type, so the
  universally quantified statements are not over an empty type;
  `blind_menu_excludes_passing` shows the menu is not `Set.univ`;
  `hidden_card_matters` shows the two merged states genuinely have different
  futures.
  Two honest costs. First, `menu` ranges over `Option (E.Action i)` rather than
  `E.Action i`, which commits the design to "the information state determines
  whether the player moves, not only what they may play". That is the standard
  assumption and makes `menu` exactly the per-player conjunct of legality, but
  without it a policy would need the hidden state to know whether to return
  `none`. Second, `IsLegalJoint` is written in `Execution.lean` as an inlined
  `∀ i, match …`, and two distinct stuck matchers are not definitionally equal,
  so the pointwise form needed a one-off case split
  (`isLegalJoint_iff_legalOption`) rather than `Iff.rfl`. A future refactor to
  `IsLegalJoint := ∀ i, LegalOption …` would remove that friction.
  A third instance of a now-familiar tactic hazard: `cases` on `Trace` fails
  with an internal motive error unless the index is typed at the protocol's
  `State` projection rather than the reduced carrier.
- **Outcome:** supports - the separated information layer survives RFC 9.1.7 for
  feasibility. A full sequential-rationality and consistency definition was
  deliberately out of scope and was not faked.
- **Next action:** build the assessment and one-shot-deviation slice on this
  interface, shaped as profile-plus-continuation per EXP-009, which is what
  closes 9.1.7's third clause.
### EXP-012: The two execution candidates on one game

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-27, Phase 3 working tree
- **Decision / question:** D6; finite-first inductive trees or general-state
  transition systems for the baseline. The RFC's criterion is that the general candidate
  wins only if the finite evaluator and the backward-induction API arise from a
  small well-founded or bounded certificate rather than from a second parallel
  semantics.
- **Representative slice:** one fair coin followed by one consequential
  decision, encoded twice - as `coinThenMove : ExecutionProtocol Unit` and as
  `coinTree : Tree Unit (fun _ => Move) Spot`
- **Evidence:** `GameTheory/Protocol/Tree.lean`,
  `GameTheory/Protocol/Execution.lean`, `GameTheory/Tests/Candidates.lean`
- **Observation:** three probes were built in before measuring, following the
  review lesson from EXP-010.
  1. *Agreement.* `candidates_agree_take` and `candidates_agree_leave` prove the
     two candidates induce the same outcome law, so neither is quietly modelling
     a different game.
  2. *Discrimination.* `takePolicy_ne_leavePolicy` and `takePlan_ne_leavePlan`
     prove each candidate's law depends on the chosen action, so neither set of
     tests would pass an evaluator that discarded the strategy.
  3. *Cost.* Finite-first: `Tree.eval` is structural recursion - total, no fuel,
     no certificate. `Tree.PureStrategy` is defined by recursion on the tree, so
     the plan type is indexed by the tree's *own* decision sites by
     construction; `Fintype` follows from finiteness of the local action
     carriers alone, and `card_pureStrategy_coinTree` computes by `rfl`. That is
     RFC D6's fifth hostile test, passed outright.
     General-state: `runFor` is fuelled and is therefore not yet an evaluator.
     Making it one took `runFor_add` (which needed the new
     `FinDist.bind_congr`), `StopsWithin`, and two stabilization theorems -
     about 25 nonblank lines, and `takePolicy_stopsWithin` discharges the
     certificate for the example in four. On the *evaluator* axis this is a
     small bounded certificate, not a second parallel semantics, so the general
     candidate meets the RFC's criterion there.
  One asymmetry is already visible and counts against general-state. The tree's
  strategy type is over the tree's own decision sites; the protocol's `Chooser`
  is a function over *every* non-terminal state, which is "all syntactically
  possible states" rather than the game's reachable decision sites. Recovering
  the latter needs an extraction step the general candidate does not yet have.
- **Outcome:** narrows, partial - both candidates encode the slice and agree;
  finite-first passes hostile test 5 outright; general-state passes the
  small-certificate criterion for the evaluator but not yet for strategy
  extraction
- **Follow-up (2026-07-27):** both open measurements were made, and a third gap
  appeared.
  *Backward induction.* `GameTheory/Protocol/Backward.lean`. `Successor` is
  `StepEvent` with its data forgotten; `WellFoundedPlay` is one line;
  `backwardRec` is `WellFounded.fix` along it. Terminal states are the
  relation's minimal elements automatically, because `Legal` already contains
  non-terminality, so no separate base-case predicate is needed. Certificate
  plus recursor is 26 nonblank lines; the concrete instance for the probe
  protocol is 22. Decisively, `backwardValue_eq_expect_runFor` proves that
  wherever `StopsWithin` holds the backward-induction value *equals* the
  expected payoff of the fuelled run law - neither is defined from the other,
  so this is not a second parallel semantics. Five probes each pair with an
  explicitly refuted mutant (`oneStepValue`, `sourceOnlyValue`,
  `chooserBlindValue`), making discrimination a theorem.
  *Strategy extraction.* `GameTheory/Protocol/Extraction.lean`. `Reachable`,
  `DecisionSite`, `SiteStrategy`, `Chooser.restrict`, and
  `runFor_congr_of_restrict_eq`: choosers agreeing on the reachable decision
  sites induce the same run law. The `ghostArena` probe exhibits an active,
  non-terminal, *unreachable* state, proves it unreachable, proves the two
  choosers genuinely differ there, and proves the runs agree anyway - so the
  faithfulness theorem is not vacuous.
  *The new gap.* Reviewing the tree candidate against the rest of D6's slice
  list shows `Tree.node` carries a single `mover`, so the finite-first candidate
  as built **cannot express simultaneous actions at all**. The general-state
  candidate handles them natively: `active` is a predicate over players and
  `step` consumes a joint action. RFC D6 explicitly says to reject finite-first
  if the simultaneous-action and MAID/FOSG slices need duplicate execution
  theories rather than a small extension, so this is the decisive remaining
  measurement and it runs the *opposite* way from the certificate count.
- **Running tally:** finite-first needs zero certificates, has intrinsic
  decision sites, and evaluates structurally, but is single-mover. General-state
  needs two certificates that do not derive from each other (`StopsWithin` is
  chooser-indexed and fuel-shaped, `WellFoundedPlay` is chooser-independent and
  order-shaped) plus an extraction construction, but handles simultaneity
  natively and its certificates are provably not a parallel semantics.
- **Simultaneity measurement (2026-07-27):** `GameTheory/Tests/Simultaneous.lean`.
  The general-state protocol takes it natively: `matching_both_active` puts two
  players on move at one state, `matching_legal_forces_both` shows a legal joint
  action must supply a move for each, and `matching_outcome_depends_on_both`
  proves the transition reads both calls. The finite-first tree cannot express
  it at all - `Tree.node` carries one `mover` - so the same game must be
  sequentialized, and `sequentialization_enlarges_strategy_space` proves that is
  not faithful: eight contingent plans against four simultaneous profiles.
  `respondingPlan` exhibits one of the extra plans, conditioning on the
  opponent's call. Making the tree faithful needs an information layer to
  quotient those plans - exactly the machinery whose absence made it cheaper on
  the certificate axis.
- **Outcome (final):** decides D6. RFC D6's disproof conditions apply
  asymmetrically: general-state-first is rejected only on a failed terminal,
  chance, locality, or finite-extraction test, and it failed none; finite-first
  is rejected if the simultaneous-action slice needs a duplicate execution or
  evaluation theory, and it needs an information layer. General-state is the
  primary interface; the tree is retained as a derived presentation for
  single-mover games, where it costs no certificate and evaluates structurally.
  The two provably agree where both apply.
- **Next action:** recorded in
  [`decisions/D6-execution-and-information.md`](decisions/D6-execution-and-information.md).
  D7 remains open, as do the assessment and one-shot-deviation slice and the
  MAID/FOSG encodings; D0 is not final until those are measured.

### EXP-013: Assessment, sequential rationality, and one-shot deviations

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-27, Phase 3 working tree
- **Decision / question:** D6 and D7, and the third clause of RFC 9.1.7.
  EXP-009 concluded that the open-game *context* is the idea worth taking while
  its carried equilibrium field and co-outcome channel are not. This tests that
  directive.
- **Representative slice:** `Context`, `value`, `IsLocallyOptimal`,
  `IsProfitableDeviation`, `IsSequentiallyRationalAt`, and four probes over a
  two-room protocol
- **Evidence:** `GameTheory/Protocol/Assessment.lean`,
  `GameTheory/Tests/Assessment.lean`
- **Observation:** the directive holds. `Context` has exactly two fields -
  `outcome : Option (Action i) → FinDist State` and
  `continuation : State → ℝ` - which is the open-game context with the
  co-outcome channel dropped, as EXP-009 measured that channel to have no
  consumer. Local optimality is a *definition* over those fields, in deliberate
  contrast to the baseline, where every open-game constructor stored its own
  `IsEquilibriumIn` and hand-wrote a Nash condition.
  `isLocallyOptimal_iff_no_profitable_deviation` is the one-shot-deviation
  interface, with both sides derived from `value`.
  `IsSequentiallyRationalAt` composes it with the information layer: the policy
  supplies the call, `menu` supplies the allowed set, and the context supplies
  the value. `deviation_legalOption` shows every alternative the deviator may
  consider is legal at every state its belief considers possible - feasibility
  without ever handing a policy a state, which is the remaining clause of
  9.1.7.
  The probes matter here more than usual, because
  `isLocallyOptimal_iff_no_profitable_deviation` is a tautology about `value`
  and would hold just as well if `value` were constant. Each probe therefore
  fixes one field and varies the other: `up_optimal_under_prefersLeft` against
  `up_not_optimal_under_prefersRight` varies only the continuation and flips the
  verdict; `outcome_map_matters` holds the continuation fixed and flips it back
  by changing only where the calls lead; `down_is_profitable_under_prefersRight`
  exhibits an actual profitable deviation rather than only denying one; and
  `belief_matters` shows the belief-built context depends on the belief.
  One honest limitation. A profile of information-local policies is
  *history*-indexed, because `infoOf` recurses over `Trace`, while `runFor`
  consumes a *state*-indexed `Chooser`. Folding a full profile into a context
  therefore needs either a history-indexed runner or a bind that is dependent on
  a law's support, and `FinDist` has neither. `Context.ofBelief` sidesteps this
  by taking a total branch and proving, via `ofBelief_congr`, that only its
  behaviour on the belief's support matters. That is enough for the one-shot
  interface, which is what the RFC asked for, but a full sequential-equilibrium
  development would need the missing piece.
- **Outcome:** supports - the context idea survives, the carried equilibrium and
  the co-outcome channel stay rejected, and 9.1.7's third clause is met for
  feasibility and one-shot deviations
- **Next action:** the history-indexed runner, or a support-dependent bind on
  `FinDist`, is the prerequisite for full sequential equilibrium; record it as a
  known gap rather than a blocker for Phase 3
### EXP-014: One execution base for two native shapes

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-28, Phase 3 working tree
- **Decision / question:** D6's disproof condition - reduce the interfaces to a
  smaller shared base if the languages cannot share `ExecutionProtocol` without
  fake players, fake actions beyond the canonical no-op, or language-specific
  escape fields. Deliverable is the written list of every language-specific
  workaround. Two native shapes were encoded, not three: an influence diagram
  and a multi-round simultaneous game. The extensive-form leg is covered only
  informally, by the imperfect-information and chance protocols in
  `GameTheory/Tests/Information.lean` and `GameTheory/Tests/Execution.lean`,
  which carry no workaround list of their own.
- **Representative slice:** a three-node MAID - one chance node, one decision
  node observing it, one utility node - compiled into `ExecutionProtocol` and
  `InformationModel`. MAID is the hardest of the three because its native shape
  is a DAG of typed nodes rather than a state machine.
- **Evidence:** `GameTheory/Languages/MAID.lean` (820 nonblank lines), whose
  `## Workarounds` section is the deliverable
- **Observation:** all three named failures are absent, each with a theorem.
  *No fake players*: the protocol's index is the diagram's own agent set, chance
  is carried by the transition law at an ownerless node, and `no_extra_agent`
  records there is no `nature` index. *No fake actions*: an agent with no
  decision node gets `Empty` rather than a padding action, and at every
  non-decision node the only legal joint action is the canonical no-op. *No
  escape fields*: the three structures were used as declared.
  The honest remainder is more interesting than the clean part. The DAG must be
  linearized, so the state space is its prefixes; for this diagram the
  topological order is unique, but the file states plainly that **a MAID with
  two incomparable decision nodes would make the compiled protocol assert an
  order the diagram does not have, and that case is untested**. The utility node
  costs an execution step whose law is a point mass, so `IsChance` cannot
  distinguish a chance node from a deterministic administrative step - node
  kinds are not recoverable from the protocol. And the encoding independently
  rediscovered the mismatch recorded in EXP-013: `runFor` is state-indexed while
  policies are history-indexed, and the bridge is sound here only because the
  stage records every resolved node's value.
  A discriminating probe (`outcome_law_depends_on_decision`) proves the compiled
  run law depends on the decision node's value, so the encoding does not
  collapse the decision away.
- **Multi-round simultaneity (2026-07-28):**
  `GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/RoundsWitness.lean`.
  Simultaneity composes across rounds with no encoding trick: `active` is a
  predicate over players so a whole round is one state, `step` consumes a joint
  action so a round resolves in one transition, and the reached state carries
  the round's outcome so round two can depend on round one. The no-op never
  appears, because `all_active_of_not_terminal` shows no state has an idle
  player. Three probes make the claim non-vacuous - both players' first-round
  calls matter, the second round is not vestigial, and the state reached after
  round one genuinely records which outcome occurred - and `stopsWithin_two`
  supplies the horizon certificate. The recorded remainder is that the middle
  state carries the first round's *outcome* rather than its actions, so a game
  whose second round depends on the exact first-round profile would need a wider
  state; nothing in the interface prevents that, but this file does not test it.
- **Outcome:** supports - both encodings share the execution base with no fake
  players, no fake actions beyond the canonical no-op, and no escape fields, each
  recorded with a theorem. Two scope limits are stated plainly rather than
  hidden: an influence diagram with two incomparable decision nodes, and a
  round-based game needing the exact previous profile.
- **Next action:** neither encoding needed an escape hatch, so the shared
  execution base stands. The certificate-versus-direct-bridge measurement is
  the remaining input to D7.
### EXP-015: Certificates against their direct bridges

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-28, Phase 3 working tree
- **Decision / question:** D7 and the finalization of D0. Phase 0 fixed an
  eight-point bridge and certificate complexity budget; a certificate level
  earns its place only against the bespoke direct bridge it replaces.
- **Representative slice:** the two encoded native shapes - an influence diagram
  and a two-round simultaneous game - each taken to a `GameForm`, with the
  static solution concepts applied to both
- **Evidence:** `GameTheory/Tests/Transfer.lean`
- **Observation:** the direct baseline is *zero*, which no certificate level can
  beat. Each language reached the static core by applying one existing generic
  function; it added no structure, no construction discharging certificate
  fields, and no evaluation theorem of its own. Both obtain their outcome law
  from the same theorem, `ExecutionProtocol.toGameForm_play`, instantiated
  twice, and `IsNash` and `WeaklyDominates` apply to both without either
  language contributing a definition or a lemma. A named adequacy record would
  add a structure, composition laws, and a per-language construction, and would
  enable nothing further: the transfer is function composition, and composing
  functions needs no witness.
  This corroborates EXP-009 from the opposite direction. That audit found a
  compositional presentation whose carried equilibrium field was *derivable*
  from native semantics, whose constructors each hand-wrote their own optimality
  condition, and whose contravariant channel had no consumer. Storing a witness
  for something already derivable is the mechanism by which a certificate
  hierarchy decays into duplicated concepts.
  The rejection is scoped, not universal: it holds for languages that compile
  *into* a shared target, and says nothing about a transfer that must preserve
  something the target forgets, such as recall or the identity of a decision
  site. No such transfer exists here yet, which is itself the reason the
  hierarchy is unamortized.
- **Outcome:** rejects D7 for the baseline - keep compilation as functions and named
  evaluation theorems; reopen only on a concrete transfer the shared static form
  provably cannot carry
- **Next action:** record
  [`decisions/D7-certificate-stratification.md`](decisions/D7-certificate-stratification.md);
  D0 can now be finalized at every semantic level.

### EXP-016: A run law indexed by history

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-28, working tree after the Phase 3 merge
- **Decision / question:** whether the run law can be indexed by history rather
  than state, so that a profile of information-local policies can actually be
  run. The recorded limitation is that `infoOf` recurses over histories while the
  runner consumes a state-indexed chooser, which blocks both the general
  strategic compilation and the one-shot-deviation theorem. The risk to test is
  that a history-indexed runner is a *second semantics*: if the state law is not
  recoverable from it, the sequential layer has two disagreeing notions of play.
- **Representative slice:** a protocol in which chance splits into two branches
  that the player observes and that then merge back into one state, so two
  histories reach the same state carrying different information
- **Evidence:** `GameTheory/Protocol/History.lean`;
  `GameTheory/Tests/History.lean`; `FinDist.bindOnSupport` and its laws
- **Observation:** the missing primitive was a support-dependent composition,
  because extending a history requires evidence that the transition was
  realized. Mathlib's `PMF.bindOnSupport` supplies it from the *same* module the
  finite-support type already imports, so the dependency budget is untouched.
  Not a second semantics: `map_state_runHistoryFor` says the state law is the
  history law's pushforward along the state each history reached, for any
  chooser that ignores the history. Everything proved about the state law
  therefore still holds.
  Strictly more expressive, and measured as such rather than asserted. In the
  merging protocol the profile that reads its branch induces a law with mass one
  half on each ending, while every state-indexed chooser induces a point mass,
  because at the merged state such a chooser has nothing left to condition on.
  The probe is checked against its own control: the profile that ignores the
  branch induces *exactly* a state chooser's law. So what the test detects is the
  use of history, not the fact of running along one — the discrimination is
  itself a theorem rather than a claim about the test.
  One simplification fell out. The state runner needed an induction to show
  everything it reaches is reachable; the history runner needs none, because a
  history is that evidence.
- **Outcome:** supports — adopt the history-indexed runner alongside the state
  one, with the pushforward theorem as the compatibility guarantee
- **Next action:** behavioral and mixed policies over the same `Policy` type,
  then the one-shot-deviation theorem. Both are prerequisites for the
  behavioral/mixed equivalence.

### EXP-017: Two places to put randomness

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-29, working tree after the history-indexed runner
- **Decision / question:** whether the sequential layer can carry both local and
  global randomization over one `Choice` type, and what an equivalence between
  them would have to assume. The risk is a third notion of play: if randomized
  running does not reduce to deterministic running, the layer accumulates
  competing semantics instead of one with special cases.
- **Representative slice:** a protocol in which one player moves twice and
  observes only whether play has stopped, so both decision points carry the same
  information state
- **Evidence:** `GameTheory/Protocol/Randomized.lean`;
  `GameTheory/Tests/Randomized.lean`; `FinDist.mem_support_pi`
- **Observation:** no third semantics. A chooser answering with point masses
  induces exactly the deterministic law, and reading a deterministic profile as
  behavioral, or as a mixed profile concentrated on it, likewise changes
  nothing — three conservativity theorems rather than three conventions. The
  independence of players' draws comes from the existing finite product of laws,
  so nothing new was needed to combine them, and menu adequacy makes every drawn
  joint action legal without a second argument.
  The two placements do *not* agree in general, and the counterexample is now
  machine-checked rather than inherited. Where one player meets one information
  state twice, a behavioral policy draws afresh and can play both actions, while
  a mixed policy is committed by its single draw and must repeat itself. The
  separating event is exactly a pair of unequal actions at a repeated
  information state.
  That fixes the shape of the eventual equivalence. It cannot be proved without
  forbidding a player to return to an information state it has already acted at,
  which is the condition the comparison corpus carries under a different name —
  and which is *not* recall. Recall governs the other direction.
- **Outcome:** narrows — keep both randomizations over the shared `Choice`; the
  equivalence needs a no-revisit hypothesis, whose necessity is now recorded as a
  theorem instead of assumed
- **Next action:** state and prove the equivalence under
  `ActsOnceAtEachInfoState`, then the direction that needs recall. The
  factorization primitive is now in place; what is not yet settled is how the
  induction carries the set of already-consulted information states, since the
  coordinates a play consults are themselves random. See the addendum below.

#### Addendum: the primitive the equivalence needs

Predicted before the equivalence was attempted, and then narrowed by building
it. The prediction was a peel law for the finite product, and that is now
`FinDist.pi_eq_map_product`: a finite product factors at any one coordinate into
that coordinate's law and an independent law of the rest. `map_apply_pi`, the
marginal, falls out of it, and the basic mass API it rests on —
`prob_map_of_injective`, `prob_product`, `map_fst_product` — was missing for
operations the module already exported.

What building it clarified is that the peel is not by itself the whole story.
The coordinates a play consults are chosen by the play, so they are random, and
an induction over fuel meets a *growing set of already-consulted information
states* rather than one fixed coordinate. Two shapes are therefore in view: peel
one coordinate and shrink the index type, which is what `pi_eq_map_product`
does; or fix a family of *distinct* coordinates and factor them all at once,
which states the independence the no-revisit condition supplies but needs a
finite-product Fubini for `expect` that this module does not have. Only the
first was built, because only the first has a consumer today.

#### Addendum: the structural half of the equivalence

Two facts that the equivalence needs and that do not touch the probabilistic
gap are now proved, so what remains of the theorem is exactly that gap.

`runFrom_congr_of_act_eq` says a profile is observable only through the
histories a run of that length can pass through — the policy analogue of the
chooser congruence over reachable decision sites. Its hypothesis is stated over
`ReachesWithin`, an over-approximation of what any particular chooser reaches,
so the condition does not mention the profile being varied. The bound is real
rather than vacuous: with no fuel, `ReachesWithin` relates a history only to
itself.

`infoOf_ne_of_actsOnce` converts the no-revisit condition into the form the
peel step consumes: having moved at one history, a player meets that information
state at no later history where it moves again. It rests on the record of where
a player has acted growing along play, which is a suffix relation over
`ReachesWithin`. Before this, the condition had only a refutation as a consumer;
it now has a positive one.

What is left is to combine the peel with these: at each step, factor the drawn
policy at the coordinate about to be consulted, match the first factor against
the behavioral draw, and use the two facts above to show the residual can be
extended arbitrarily at that coordinate.

#### Addendum: how the shrinking index is avoided

The obstruction recorded above — that the index type shrinks while the induction
hypothesis quantifies over full profiles — is avoidable, and both remedies first
recorded here were worse than the one now adopted. **Commit the consumed
coordinate instead of deleting it.**

`BehavioralPolicy.commit` fixes one information state to a point mass and leaves
the rest alone, and `toMixed_commit` is the identity that makes it work:
re-extending the residual of a factored draw with a fixed choice is again the
mixed reading of a behavioral profile — the committed one. It is
`pi_eq_map_product` read for the committed family. So the induction hypothesis
never leaves full profiles; the set of already-consumed information states is
encoded as the coordinates that have become point masses, and point masses need
no bookkeeping.

`runBehavioralFrom_congr` is what then makes the commitment invisible on the
continuation, since `infoOf_ne_of_actsOnce` says the consumed coordinate is
never consulted again.

Why the two alternatives were worse. Generalizing over a consumed set would put
the statement on types that change at every step, and moving between them is
`Equiv` juggling — precisely what produces the source-level transport tokens
this layer budgets at zero. Proving the distinct-family factorization outright
would need a finite-product Fubini for expectations, and the step case does not
need one: mass-level factorization is `prod` algebra over the existing lemmas,
and the sequencing unfolds from `product`'s own definition.

One point worth recording because it nearly went the other way: committing a
coordinate is a pointwise update of a dependent function, which transports a
value along an equality of information states, and both spellings of that —
`Function.update` and `▸` — are already forbidden in this layer. Building it
from `Equiv.piSplitAt`, the same decomposition the factorization uses, needs
neither, and the audits confirm the layer's counts are unchanged.

#### Addendum: two refinements found by attempting the step

The interchange lemmas the step case needs are proved: `pi_map`, that
independent draws commute with coordinatewise pushforward, and `map_pi_product`,
that independent draws of pairs are a pair of independent draws. Neither needed
a Fubini for expectations. `pi_map` does not follow from the injective
pushforward rule, since relabelling coordinatewise is not injective; it goes
through a finite superset of the support and the distributivity of a product of
sums over a product index, which Mathlib already has.

Attempting the step turned up two things the plan as designed does not cover.

*A commitment must also be invisible where the player does not move.* The
no-revisit condition speaks only about information states a player has *acted*
at, but a profile is consulted at every player at every history, so a
commitment could survive to a later visit at which the player is idle. It cannot
matter, and for a reason already in the design: an inactive player's menu is the
single option `none`, so its choices at that information state form a
subsingleton and every law over them is the same law. Locality by typing settles
it with no argument about what play does next.

*Agreement is only needed where play has not stopped.* Both congruences now
quantify over reachable *non-terminal* histories. Otherwise a protocol calling a
player active at a state it has already stopped at would demand agreement the
runner never consults — a hypothesis stronger than the theorem needs, and one
with no fact available to discharge it.

#### Result: the equivalence

`runMixedFrom_toMixed` is proved. Under `ActsOnceAtEachInfoState`, randomizing
at each information state and randomizing once over whole policies induce the
same law over histories, at every fuel and from every history.

The induction follows play and never leaves full profiles. At each step the
drawn policy is factored at the information states about to be consulted, its
first factor is matched against the local draw — the two sides then take
*literally* the same joint action — and the rest is re-read as the mixed profile
that has committed there. The commitment is invisible afterwards for one of two
reasons, and both are needed: the coordinate is never consulted again while the
player moves, or the player does not move there and its menu was a single option
all along.

The theorem is not vacuous and the condition is not idle. Both are checked on
the two protocols in the test file, which differ in exactly the feature the
hypothesis names: voting twice at one information state separates the two
randomizations, voting once satisfies the condition, and the equivalence is
instantiated there.

What this settles about the direction that needs recall: nothing. This is the
direction that needs none, exactly as the comparison corpus's structure predicted,
and the condition it does need is about being asked twice rather than about
memory.

### EXP-018: Recovering local randomization from a single draw

- **Date / revision:** reserved 2026-07-29, before any attempt
- **Decision / question:** the converse direction. Given a mixed profile, is
  there a behavioral profile inducing the same law, and does the construction
  live in the existing layer? This is the direction that needs recall, and the
  one whose real obligations the architecture record found to be much larger
  than its label suggests. It tests the accepted interfaces, not the certificate
  decision: an equivalence of two strategy representations within one
  information model is not a transfer between languages, and both of its sides
  already live in the same layer. The architecture record has been corrected
  accordingly.
- **Representative slice:** one game under two signal designs. The same two-vote
  protocol that separates the randomizations, given signals that let the player
  see its own vote — so the slice is a change of observation map, not a bigger
  game.
- **Prediction, written before attempting.** The behavioral action law at an
  information state is the mixed law conditioned on reaching it, so the missing
  primitive in the finite-support layer is a *conditional law on an event of
  positive mass* — the analogue of the coordinate factorization that the forward
  direction needed, and predicted here for the same reason: it is the operation
  the definition is phrased in. Two further obligations are expected, both named
  in the architecture record rather than discovered: reach-mass factorization,
  and player-local action posteriors. Perfect recall is expected to enter as the
  hypothesis making the conditioning consistent across the histories in one
  information set, not as a field carrying the conclusion.
  One thing is expected *not* to be a problem. Conditioning is undefined at an
  information state play never reaches, so the constructed profile must be given
  some arbitrary value there. That is already known to be unobservable: the
  congruences say a profile is seen only through the histories a run can pass
  through.
- **Evidence so far:** `GameTheory/Math/Probability/FinDist.lean`, the conditioning
  section; the reachability probe run against
  `Mathlib.Probability.ProbabilityMassFunction.Constructions`
- **Observation so far:** the prediction is confirmed on *what* is needed and
  was wrong about the cost. Conditioning is the right primitive, but the obvious
  route to it is closed: Mathlib's `PMF.filter` and `PMF.normalize` live in
  `ProbabilityMassFunction.Constructions`, and importing that module makes both
  `stdSimplex` and `Polynomial` reachable again — measured directly, and exactly
  the two constants the narrowed import was chosen to exclude and that the phase
  audits probe for. Taking the easy route would have silently widened the
  dependency of everything downstream of the law type.
  Hand-building it costs about fifty lines and needs only the probability monad,
  so the budget is unchanged. `condOn` restricts a law to an event it gives
  positive mass and renormalizes; `probOf` is the event's real mass, positive
  under the same hypothesis. Conditioning on everything changes nothing, which is
  the cheap check that the normalization is the intended one.
  Worth recording as a general lesson rather than a local one: a missing
  primitive being *available in Mathlib* is not the same as it being *available
  here*, and the difference is only visible if the dependency is measured before
  the import is taken.
- **Outcome:** *in progress*
- **Second observation: recall is a property of `infoOf`, and both existing
  slices fail it.** `ownPlay` records the (information state, action) pairs a
  player's own moves leave along a history, and `actedAt` is that record with the
  actions forgotten. `PerfectRecall` then says two histories producing one
  information state leave the same own record. Stating it that way is what
  keeps the conditioning event a function of the information state alone, and it
  structurally excludes the failure the open-game audit warned about: the
  consistent-policy set will be a definition over the record, and recall stays a
  hypothesis about `infoOf` rather than a field carrying the conclusion.
  Neither protocol in the test file satisfies it, and both refutations are
  machine-checked. Each observes only whether play has stopped, so neither can
  tell what it did. That also settles the open question of the representative
  slice: it is a different *signal design* — a player that sees its own
  actions — not a bigger game. And it separates two conditions that could be
  confused: voting once satisfies the no-revisit condition while still failing
  recall.

- **Predicted next, before building.** Two things, recorded now so the outcome is
  evidence either way. First, the default at information states play never
  reaches costs nothing and needs no hypothesis: every law has nonempty support,
  so the given mixed policy admits a witness policy, and that witness supplies a
  legal choice everywhere — including where menu adequacy says nothing and the
  menu could otherwise be empty. The congruences already make the default
  unobservable. Second, the primitives after `condOn` are its tower properties:
  an expectation decomposed through a conditioning over a partition, which is
  what reach-mass factorization is, and iterated conditioning collapsing to the
  intersection event.

- **Third observation: recall is a property of the observation map, and the
  slice shows it.** The same game carries both designs. Told only whether play
  has stopped, the player fails recall and the two randomizations provably
  differ; told its own vote, it satisfies recall *and* the no-revisit condition,
  and the equivalence applies — the separation disappears with nothing about the
  game changed. The information state in the second design *is* the player's own
  record, which is why recall holds by computation rather than by assumption.
  This is also the first slice on which both conditions hold at once, so it is
  the one the recall direction will be built against.

- **Fourth observation: the construction lands, and the default really is
  free.** `recordAt` reads a player's own record off *some* history producing an
  information state, and `recordAt_eq_ownPlay` is where recall does its work:
  with it, that record is the record along *every* such history, so the arbitrary
  choice is no choice. `Consistent` then names the pure policies whose own
  answers match a record, and `toBehavioral` conditions the single draw on them
  and takes the action's law.
  The predicted-free default is confirmed. At an information state no history
  produces, the conditioning event can have no mass, and the value is taken from
  a policy the law does give mass to — which costs nothing, because every law has
  something in its support and a policy already chooses legally everywhere,
  *including* where the menu law says nothing and the menu could otherwise be
  empty. No hypothesis was added, and the degenerate check passes on both
  branches at once: a draw concentrated on one policy reads back as that policy
  whether or not the information state was reachable.

- **Fifth observation: the induction is assembled except for one wrinkle, and
  the wrinkle narrows the earlier prediction.** Every step of the argument is now
  in place. The behavioral draw at a history *is* the marginal of the single
  draw, because the profile's support already lies in the consistency event, so
  conditioning there does nothing. The single draw disintegrates along the joint
  answer it gives, the observed part matches the behavioral draw exactly, and
  the remainder is the profile conditioned on that answer, which splits back
  into one conditioning per player because nothing couples them. What a step
  commits a player to is permanent, so the tower property makes the accumulated
  conditioning invisible afterwards.
  The wrinkle is the default. The earlier prediction — that the value at an
  information state play never reaches costs nothing — is right about
  *well-definedness* and wrong about the *proof*. The default must also be
  **stable under conditioning**, and the one chosen is not: it is read off the
  law's own support, and a conditioned law has a smaller support, so the two can
  disagree at an information state where no consistent policy has mass. The
  behavioral congruence quantifies over histories a run *could* reach rather
  than those a given profile does reach, so that disagreement is visible to it.
  The fix is to parameterize the fallback and hold it fixed across the
  induction, which makes the reading determined up to its behaviour where play
  never goes — a scope statement worth making explicit rather than a defect.
  Recorded rather than applied, because it changes a public definition.

- **Outcome: supports.** `runMixedFrom_toBehavioralWith` is proved. Where every
  player recalls its own play, drawing a whole policy once induces the same law
  as randomizing afresh at each information state — at every fuel and from every
  history the draw could already have reached, which at the start of play is no
  hypothesis at all.
  Parameterizing the fallback closed the gap exactly as diagnosed, and the reason
  is worth keeping: it is the complement of the commitment lemma rather than a
  workaround. Between the original law and the conditioned one the dichotomy in
  the reading is stable — consistent mass survives the conditioning, so the
  marginal branch of one reading is the marginal branch of the other and the
  double conditioning collapses — and the only case the commitment lemma cannot
  reach is fallback against fallback, which a shared fixed parameter makes an
  equality by construction. Together the two cover both branches.
  The statement that results is the honest one: the behavioral reading of a
  single draw is determined up to its behaviour where play never goes.

- **Sixth observation, from comparing with the snapshot.** The conditions proved
  here are cruder than the ones the snapshot proves. Its no-repeat condition
  permits a repeat when the action set there is a subsingleton, and its recall
  direction rests on reach-mass conditions with recall only sufficient. The
  first gap is now closed: the condition is weakened to permit a repeat where the
  *menu* holds a single option — a finer site than the action carrier, since an
  information state can offer many actions and still leave one legal — and the
  counterexample is checked against the weakened form, so the separation survives
  it. The second gap is reserved as its own experiment.
  Two places where the comparison runs the other way, both visible in the
  snapshot's own statements. Its global determinism condition puts a transport
  inside a public hypothesis and its posterior-locality condition is stated
  through `HEq`, both because its information projection lives over
  length-indexed lists; neither appears here, because reachability is intrinsic
  to a history. And its construction takes a global inhabitance instance for the
  action carriers, where the fallback here is derived from the law's own support.

- **Seventh observation: the fallback parameter turned out to be internal.**
  The reading with nothing supplied satisfies the theorem too, because the
  fallback is fixed across the induction whatever it is, and a law's own support
  witness is one such fixed choice. So the parameter is a device the proof needs
  and not part of the result, and the quotable statement carries no trace of it.
  The two directions are now stated together: the laws a profile of locally
  randomizing players can induce are exactly the laws a single draw over policies
  can induce, and both halves are instantiated on the recall-capable slice.

- **Next action:** the reach-mass generalization, reserved separately.

### EXP-019: Reach-mass conditions instead of recall

- **Date / revision:** reserved 2026-07-29, before any attempt
- **Decision / question:** D7, asked again with a candidate consumer. The pinned
  snapshot proves the recall direction not from recall but from three conditions
  about *reach mass*: that two profiles reaching a state give it the same mass,
  that reaching it factors coordinatewise, and that the posterior at an
  information state does not depend on which reaching history produced it.
  Recall is demoted to a sufficient condition. That is strictly more general than
  what is proved here, and it is also, structurally, a named adequacy
  certificate — the stratification rejected earlier on a baseline of zero
  consumers. Restating the theorem over such conditions would be the *first*
  genuine consumer of a certificate level. A second — an encoded language
  discharging the same conditions, or a correlated-realization layer resting on
  the same factorization — would meet the recorded two-consumer budget. So this
  experiment is about the architecture as much as the theorem.
- **Representative slice:** the recall-capable two-vote design, which already
  satisfies both directions' current hypotheses, plus at least one model that
  fails recall while still factoring — the case the generalization is *for*, and
  which nothing here yet exhibits.
- **Prediction, written before attempting.** The three conditions are statable
  transport-free over the existing history and information vocabulary. The
  snapshot states them with a `▸` inside a hypothesis and with `HEq`, because its
  information projection lives over length-indexed lists; histories as data,
  where reachability is intrinsic to the type, should remove both. That is the
  falsifiable part: if the conditions *cannot* be stated without transport, the
  finding is about where the generality belongs — an internal lemma rather than
  a public hypothesis — and it is decision-grade either way rather than a proof
  failure.
  Predicted also: the global determinism side condition the snapshot's
  perfect-recall corollary carries will not be needed, for the same reason, and
  the fallback will not need a global inhabitance instance, since it is already
  derived from the law's own support.
- **Evidence so far:**
  `GameTheory/Experimental/Phase4/ReachMassStatements.lean`
- **First observation: the falsifiable half of the prediction holds.** All three
  conditions are statable in this library's vocabulary with **no transport
  token in any statement** — checked by scanning the file, where the only
  occurrences of `▸` and `HEq` are in prose describing the snapshot.
  How each one avoids it is different, and worth separating. The mass condition
  is direct. The factorization condition needs a pointwise variant of a joint
  action, which *is* a transport in the obvious spelling — the same collision the
  commitment construction met — and none in the coordinate-decomposition
  spelling this layer already uses; so it is avoided by an idiom rather than by
  luck. The posterior condition is the one the snapshot states through
  heterogeneous equality, and quantifying over the information state *before* the
  objects indexed by it removes the need entirely: both sides land in one type by
  construction.
  Sufficiency is checked in the same file, in the direction that matters for not
  fooling oneself: recall implies the posterior condition, because it makes the
  two records equal. So the condition is genuinely weaker than recall rather than
  a restatement of it, and it is not vacuous.
- **Second observation: the generalization is not the snapshot's three
  conditions.** Looking for a model that fails recall while satisfying them
  turned up something better. Nothing downstream reads a player's record except
  through the *set of policies it rules out*, so the hypothesis the proof
  actually uses is that two histories a player cannot tell apart constrain its
  policy the same way. That is `ConstrainsAlike`, it is strictly weaker than
  recall, and the whole recall direction now runs on it — the combined statement
  included.
  The gap is real and cheap to witness: records differing only in the *order* of
  a player's own moves rule out the same policies, so a player that forgets the
  order fails recall and still constrains alike. Multiplicity goes the same way.
  On the snapshot's posterior-locality condition, exactly one direction is
  proved: `ConstrainsAlike` implies it, restated in the experimental file from
  the weaker hypothesis. The converse is an *argument*, not a theorem, and it is
  recorded as such — reweighting by reach probability multiplies the
  compatibility indicator by a constant in the player's own coordinate, and
  constants wash out under normalization. Two gaps keep it from being exact.
  The washout is informal, and the snapshot's condition is *guarded*: it
  constrains nothing when a law's support misses one of the two events, so
  agreement-under-guards is strictly weaker than equality of the constraint
  sets. Closing that would mean guarding `ConstrainsAlike` the same way and
  checking the proof still runs — every use of the set equality does sit inside
  a support-meeting context, so it plausibly does, but it needs a
  support-relative form of the nested-conditioning law and is not attempted
  here.
- **Third observation: the other two conditions have no content here, and the
  reason is structural.** This needs no new experiment — the theorem already
  proved assumes neither, so as hypotheses of *this* theorem in *this* layer
  they are simply unnecessary. What is worth recording is why, and one half of it
  is artifact-backed rather than argued.
  The snapshot must *assume* that reaching a state factors player by player,
  because it conditions on reach probability and reach is not a product event.
  Here the conditioning event is a product event *by construction* — the fibre of
  the joint answer is exactly the per-player answer events — and the split is
  then a theorem about the law type, proved unconditionally: independent draws
  stay independent under conditioning on a product event. So the snapshot's
  factorization hypothesis corresponds to something this layer proves rather than
  assumes.
  The mass condition has no counterpart at all, for the same underlying reason:
  no reach mass is ever formed. The conditioning is on a compatibility event,
  which is `0`/`1`, so there is nothing whose value could depend on the route.
- **Outcome:** narrows, and answers the certificate question negatively for a
  second and better reason. The level rejected earlier had no consumer; this one
  has no *content* — its conditions are either unnecessary or theorems of the
  layer that would have hosted them.
- **Fourth observation: the guarded sharpening is a level without a consumer,
  and the same budget that rejected the certificate rejects it.** Its
  prerequisite is done and was worth doing on its own: nested conditioning now
  asks the smaller event to be smaller only *where the law lives*, which is the
  true statement — what a law does outside its support is not something
  conditioning can see. The earlier form was an artefact of the first proof.
  Threading that through would replace the theorem's hypothesis by one relative
  to the profile being run: the constraint sets need agree only on that
  profile's support. That is genuinely weaker. But it is weaker in a direction
  nothing yet asks for — a model failing the profile-independent condition while
  satisfying the relative one for the profile at hand — and the quotable
  statement would stay the profile-independent one regardless. By the rule this
  project applies to everything else, that is a level to build when something
  needs it and not before.
  Recorded rather than built, and with the extra generality of the underlying
  lemma honestly unexercised at present: its one caller discards it.
- **Next action:** none open. Reopen if a model appears that needs the relative
  condition.

### EXP-020: the reducibility bill for bundled carriers

- **Date / revision:** reserved 2026-07-29, before any change
- **Decision / question:** D1, revisited at its recorded checkpoint. The
  signature-ownership choice — a form *stores* its signature rather than being
  indexed by it — was accepted provisionally, with the cost to be re-measured
  once a second layer had been built on it. That layer exists, and the same
  choice was repeated in it: an execution protocol stores its state and action
  carriers, and an information model stores its signal and information carriers.
  The question is whether the accumulated bill justifies a flip, and it has to be
  asked now because every module added makes a flip more expensive.
- **Measurement, current tree.** Thirty-two `@[reducible]` annotations exist in
  the library and every one of them is forced by a stored carrier. By the
  structure whose instance carries them: execution protocols 12, information
  signals 5, information models 5, the influence diagram's own record 4, and one
  each for a game form, a rational table, a tree strategy type, a Bayesian game,
  and a carrier alias. Not one is there for a reason of its own.
  The unit of cost is therefore *per instance, per structure*: a concrete
  protocol with its signals and its model costs three annotations before it
  proves anything, and forgetting one is not a warning but an elaboration
  failure at some distant use site.
  There is a second cost the count does not show. An induction over the
  history type additionally needs its index written at the structure's
  projection rather than at the carrier the projection reduces to; written the
  other way it fails inside the equation compiler rather than at the statement.
- **Prediction, written before attempting.** A flip removes the annotations and
  replaces them with an index on every mention of the structure, so the question
  is not whether the bill exists but which bill is smaller and which failure mode
  is kinder. Predicted: the indexed form is *not* obviously better, because the
  measured cost is one annotation per instance while the indexed cost is one
  extra argument per *mention*, and mentions outnumber instances by a large
  factor in the proved material. Predicted also that the deciding evidence is
  not the count but the failure mode — an omitted `@[reducible]` fails late and
  confusingly, whereas a missing index fails immediately at the signature.
  If that prediction survives, the outcome is to keep the bundled form and record
  the annotation as a known, bounded tax with a lint rather than a redesign.
- **Evidence:** `GameTheory/Experimental/Phase4/D1/IndexedProtocol.lean` — the
  same execution interface with its two carriers promoted to parameters, carried
  as far as a concrete instance and an induction over histories.
- **Observation: the spike confirms both costs vanish, and refutes the mechanism
  the prediction rested on.**
  Both costs do vanish. The concrete instance needs no reducibility annotation,
  because there is no projection for anything downstream to get stuck on. And
  the induction over histories goes through with its index written at the
  carrier — the spelling that fails under the bundled form, where it must be
  written at the structure's projection instead. Here there is no other way to
  write it.
  The prediction that the count favours bundling is wrong, and wrong about *why*.
  It assumed each mention of the structure pays for the promotion. It does not:
  the thirty-three type positions are absorbed by a `variable` declaration, as
  they are in the spike. What the count actually shows runs the other way — the
  library contains **243** projections of a stored carrier, every one of them a
  site where the reducibility of the instance has to fire, and all of them
  carried by **22** annotations. The bundled form is not paying one annotation
  per instance; it is paying one annotation per instance to keep 243 sites
  elaborating, and an omission is felt at some subset of them rather than where
  it was made.
  So the count does not favour bundling. It is closer to neutral-to-against, and
  the deciding evidence remains the one the prediction did get right: the failure
  mode.
- **Outcome:** *in progress* — the prediction is narrowed rather than confirmed,
  and the decision is not yet made. Two things the spike does not measure: the
  transport burden that made bundling attractive on the static layer in the first
  place, which was the original competition's subject and is not re-run here; and
  whether anything in the library needs a collection of protocols with differing
  carriers, which only the bundled form admits.
- **Second observation: nothing requires bundling, and the static layer halves
  rather than clears.**
  Nothing in the library needs the carriers stored. No structure holds a protocol
  as a field, nothing quantifies over protocols whose carriers must vary, and no
  signature mentions two of them. The one argument that would have settled the
  question in bundling's favour — that some use needs a collection of protocols
  with differing carriers — has no instance here.
  At the static layer, where the decision was actually taken, the cost is
  smaller than the sequential one and the spike says so rather than overstating
  it. Indexing removes the two facts the accepted design must state,
  `mapOutcome_sig` and `mixed_sig`, along with the two annotations that make them
  hold: with no projection there is nothing to state and the form transformers
  can be plain definitions. It does **not** remove the need for the two
  `GameSignature` transformers to be reducible — the indexed form's field types
  still reduce through them. Four annotations against two: a halving, not an
  elimination.
  The cascade is shallow. Exactly two structures store one of these: a form
  stores a signature, and a utility game stores a form.
- **Next action:** the flip cost on real code. Both spikes are greenfield, and
  what a fresh file looks like is not what moving `Execution.lean` and its ten
  dependents costs. That measurement is the one thing still missing, and it is
  the one that decides.

### EXP-021: the one-shot deviation principle

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-29
- **Decision / question:** the sequential gate recorded the one-shot-deviation
  *interface* but not the principle, and recorded that the principle could not be
  stated because the runner was indexed by state. That obstruction was removed
  earlier. The question is whether the principle now follows, and whether it
  needs anything the layer does not already have.
- **Representative slice:** a coin decides whether the player chooses at all, and
  its one choice is worth `1` against `0` — the smallest protocol in which a
  policy can be locally unimprovable without that being automatic.
- **Evidence:** `GameTheory/Protocol/Backward.lean`;
  `GameTheory/Protocol/Assessment.lean`; `GameTheory/Tests/OneShot.lean`
- **Observation.** The principle holds and needs no new certificate. A chooser
  that no single legal action improves — measured against its *own* continued
  play — is at least as good as every other chooser, at every state. The
  induction runs along the same `Successor` relation the value recursion already
  uses, so the well-foundedness certificate carries both and no second hypothesis
  appears anywhere in the statement.
  It reads forward as well as backward: where both choosers have stopped, the
  same conclusion is a statement about run laws, via the bridge already proved
  between the two semantics. And it meets the assessment interface: a chooser no
  single action improves is *locally optimal* in the context its own continuation
  induces, for any allowed set and any way of turning a choice into a joint
  action.
  **The principle is an equivalence**, and getting there corrected a claim worth
  correcting. It first looked as though the converse were blocked by the same
  pointwise-update obstacle met three times before. It is not, and the reason
  gives the right taxonomy for all four.
  A chooser's *answer* is a joint action, and that type does not mention the
  state — only the legality certificate does. So the chooser that plays one
  action at one state and follows the original elsewhere is constructible with no
  transport of data at all; the certificate is repaired by rewriting inside a
  proof, which is not what the budget measures. The recovery then needs one more
  thing, and the certificate supplies it again: a state is not reachable from its
  own successors, since that would be a descending chain, so the deviant agrees
  with the original everywhere the recursion looks after the first step.
  The taxonomy, replacing the count: the obstacle is real only where a *data*
  type depends on the point being updated. Policies are such a case — a choice's
  type depends on the information state — and that is why the commitment
  construction needed the coordinate decomposition. Choosers are not, and were
  never stuck. Two genuine instances with one shared idiom, one dependent rewrite
  needing its value named, and one case that only looked like the others.
  Both directions are checked on the slice: the grabbing policy satisfies the
  one-step condition, the passing policy provably fails it, and the conclusion is
  not vacuous — passing really is worse at the root. So the principle detects
  optimality rather than something the protocol hands to any policy.
- **Outcome:** supports — the sequential flagship pair is complete.
- **Next action:** the static-core harvest, which has been unblocked since the
  incentive gate and touches none of this. Its first family — elimination of
  strictly dominated strategies — is done and is recorded with the code rather
  than here, since it is ordinary mathematics against a settled API rather than
  an architecture experiment.

### EXP-022: what existence costs, measured before it is bought

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-29
- **Decision / question:** the harvest's remaining flagship at the static layer
  is an existence theorem that does not assume a potential. The layering was
  built so that convexity and topology stay out of the core until something
  needs them, and the discipline is to measure the import before taking it
  rather than to discover the cost afterwards.
- **Evidence:** probes against the pinned Mathlib, run before writing any proof.
- **Observation, and it refutes the planned route.** **Mathlib has no Brouwer
  fixed-point theorem and no Kakutani fixed-point theorem.** Every occurrence of
  the second name is the Riesz–Markov–Kakutani *representation* theorem, which is
  unrelated; the only fixed-point theorems available are Banach's for contracting
  maps and the order-theoretic ones. Sperner's name is present but attached to
  the antichain theorem, not the lemma about simplex colourings. So the standard
  route to equilibrium existence for finite games is not merely expensive here —
  it is absent *from Mathlib*, and supplying it from scratch would be a topology
  project of its own, far outside this library. **This observation stands; the
  conclusion originally drawn from it did not, and EXP-023 records the
  correction.** Mathlib was treated as the only source of a primitive, which is
  a question about the ecosystem rather than about Mathlib, and the probe run
  here could not answer it.
  The redirect is real and was found by the same search. Mathlib *does* have
  **Sion's version of the von Neumann minimax theorem**, in saddle-point form.
  That reaches the two-player zero-sum flagship, which is the existence result
  this layer can actually have.
  On the dependency question the measurement is more precise than expected.
  Importing Sion's theorem makes **neither `stdSimplex` nor `Polynomial`
  reachable** — the existing probes would not fire on it at all. The budget is
  not spent by the theorem; it is spent by the *bridge*, which has to present a
  finite-support law as a compact convex subset of a topological vector space,
  and that is what pulls convexity in.
- **Outcome:** refutes the planned route and redirects it. General equilibrium
  existence is out of reach at the Mathlib level; zero-sum minimax is in reach,
  and the dependency boundary sits at the law-to-simplex bridge rather than at
  the theorem.
- **Next action:** design that boundary before building on it — a root that Core
  and Protocol do not import, with its own probe expectations recorded rather
  than an exception patched into the existing ones. Nothing needs it until the
  bridge is attempted, so it is queued rather than urgent.
- **Superseded in part by EXP-023.** The redirect to minimax remains available
  and the bridge remains the place the budget is spent. The claim that general
  existence is out of reach does not survive: the primitive exists outside
  Mathlib.

### EXP-023: buying the fixed-point primitive, measured before it is imported

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-29
- **Decision / question:** EXP-022 concluded that general equilibrium existence
  was out of reach because the pinned Mathlib carries no Brouwer or Kakutani
  theorem. That conclusion silently assumed Mathlib is the only place a
  primitive can come from. It is not: a standalone Lean 4 package proves both.
  The question is therefore not whether the theorem exists but what taking it
  costs, and whether the layering survives the taking.
- **Evidence:** `harfe/fixed-point-theorems-lean4`, pinned in `lakefile.lean` at
  `770940ddf9878cf61952ed53d910b92bca841838`; `lake update`; `lake build
  FixedPointTheorems.kakutani FixedPointTheorems.brouwer`; axiom and
  reachability probes run against the built package.
- **Observation.** Six measurements, all taken before any of our own code
  imported it.

  *Version skew: none.* The package pins `leanprover/lean4:v4.32.0` and
  `mathlib @ v4.32.0`, which are exactly this project's pins. Its README still
  advertises v4.30.0; the repository does not, and the repository is what
  resolves. Predicted skew was two toolchain minors, and the prediction was
  wrong in the favourable direction.

  *Disturbance to the existing dependency graph: none.* After `lake update` the
  manifest gained exactly one entry and every pre-existing revision is
  byte-identical. Mathlib's post-update hook downloaded nothing, which is the
  same fact from the other side.

  *Build cost: six modules, about a minute, and 484 additional Mathlib modules.*
  The full build went from 2558 jobs to 3048. The package's own six are the
  visible cost; the 484 are the real one, and they are convexity, topology, and
  finite-dimensional normed spaces.

  *Trust: clean.* `brouwer_fixed_point` and `kakutani_fixed_point` each depend
  on `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound` and nothing else. No `sorryAx`,
  no custom axiom. This is the measurement that decides admissibility, since a
  dependency carrying a hole would make every theorem above it untrusted.

  *Shape: usable as-is.* Kakutani is stated for a convex compact nonempty
  `s : Set V` in a finite-dimensional real normed space, with `f : s -> Set V`
  having a closed graph and convex nonempty values inside `s`, concluding
  `exists x : s, x.1 in f x`. `closedGraph f` unfolds to
  `IsClosed {z | z.2 in f z.1}`, a plain definition rather than a class. That is
  the best-response correspondence's exact shape, so no restatement layer is
  needed between the package and the equilibrium argument.

  *Containment: the probes fire, and that is the point.* A file importing
  `FixedPointTheorems.kakutani` reaches **both** `stdSimplex` and `Polynomial` —
  the two constants the existing audit requires Core and the executable frontend
  never to see. Where Sion's theorem cost nothing against those probes, this
  package spends the whole convexity budget. So the dependency is admissible
  only behind a root the audited layers do not import, and the audit has to say
  so rather than leave it to discipline.
- **Outcome:** supports, and reopens what EXP-022 closed. The primitive is
  available, trustworthy, and free of version friction; the general existence
  route is a bridge-building problem rather than a topology project. The cost is
  a second external dependency and a genuinely leaky import surface, which the
  boundary exists to contain.
- **Next action:** instantiate `GameTheory.Analysis` as that boundary, with the
  existing six probes required to keep passing and the new root's reachability
  recorded as expected rather than exempted. the baseline snapshot took the same
  dependency and built roughly four and a half thousand lines on it (Schauder,
  KKM, Scarf, the simplex approximation layer, Loomis); the harvest should
  measure how much of that a finite-game existence theorem actually needs before
  porting any of it.
- **Follow-through, same day.** The boundary was instantiated and the theorem it
  was taken for is proved: `GameTheory/Analysis` holds the law-to-simplex
  bridge, the payoff polynomial, and Kakutani applied to the best-reply
  correspondence, and `exists_isNash_mixed` depends on the three standard axioms
  only. Three hundred and fifty-one lines above the dependency, and none of
  the comparison design's four and a half thousand were needed. The containment checks are in
  `scripts/phase2-audit.ps1`; the direction of the new probe is the part worth
  remembering, since it asserts reachability rather than absence.

### EXP-024: what the preference vocabulary is actually about

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-29
- **Decision / question:** every theorem so far has compared outcome *laws*, so
  nothing has yet tested whether `WeakPreference` is a preference type that
  happens to be applied to laws or a law type wearing a preference's name.
  Social choice is the discriminating case: it ranks alternatives, quantifies
  over all such rankings, and contains no probability at any point.
- **Evidence:** a reading of `GameTheory/Core/Preference.lean` against what a
  social choice theorem needs, followed by the repair and a full rebuild.
- **Observation, and it is a defect.** Of the sixteen declarations in the
  preference vocabulary, **thirteen never mention the law structure they are
  stated over**. Reflexivity, transitivity, totality, the strict part and its
  three lemmas, the weaker-than order, and the whole coalition lifting are
  relation algebra pinned to `FinDist Outcome` for no reason. Only convexity
  under mixing and the pullback along a relabeling use it.
  A second defect sits underneath the first. The vocabulary is *agent-indexed*
  throughout, and a social ranking has no agent: society is one ranking, not a
  family. Stating that society is transitive in the same words the voters are
  transitive was not possible.
  Delegating to Mathlib is not the repair. Its `Transitive`, `Reflexive`, and
  `Total` on bare relations are deprecated in favour of `IsTrans`, `Std.Refl`,
  and `Std.Total`, which are typeclasses — and a preference here must stay an
  argument, since one carrier is routinely studied under several preferences at
  once. Measured, not assumed: the deprecation warnings are what the probe
  returned.
- **Repair, and its cost.** The vocabulary splits in two. `Rank` states each law
  for a single comparison over an arbitrary carrier; `Preference` states it as
  that law holding for every agent, and is *definitionally* that. `Ranking Agent
  α` is the family type and `WeakPreference Agent Outcome` is its specialization
  to laws.
  The cost was zero. Every use site in the library continues to elaborate
  unchanged — 3277 build jobs, no downstream edit, both audits still verified —
  because currying makes the new definitions defeq to the old ones.
- **Downstream theorem.** `Examples/Voting.lean` proves the Condorcet paradox:
  three voters ranking three alternatives in rotation are individually total and
  transitive, and the majority ranking they induce is not transitive, with the
  cycle exhibited. Individual rationality and social irrationality are stated in
  the same words, and no probability appears in either.
- **Outcome:** finds a real defect in a core type and repairs it at no cost. The
  vocabulary was about lotteries by accident rather than by design, and nothing
  had yet asked.
- **Next action:** the repair makes Arrow's theorem statable; it does not make it
  proved. That is the honest next target on this axis, and it will exercise the
  vocabulary far harder than the paradox does.

### EXP-025: information-local compilation and the one-shot bridge

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `ecc927b`
- **Decision / question:** D6 and the RFC's composed execution/information
  requirement; whether information-local pure, behavioral, and mixed policies
  reach `GameForm` through the existing history run laws, and whether a
  unilateral one-shot change has the same law before and after compilation.
- **Representative slice:** compile a finite-horizon `InformationModel` with
  strategies `Policy`, use `run`, `runBehavioral`, and `runMixed` as the only
  evaluators, connect the two randomization representations to the compiled
  form, and instantiate the bridge on the existing imperfect-information test
  protocol.
- **Evidence:** `GameTheory/Protocol/Strategic.lean`,
  `GameTheory/Protocol/Assessment.lean`,
  `GameTheory/Protocol/Information.lean`,
  `GameTheory/Math/Probability/FinDist.lean`,
  `GameTheory/Tests/Strategic.lean`, and
  `GameTheory/Tests/Assessment.lean`. Validation:
  `lake build GameTheory.Protocol.Strategic`,
  `lake build GameTheory.Tests.Strategic`,
  `lake build GameTheory.Protocol.Assessment`,
  `lake build GameTheory.Tests.Assessment`, and the final `lake build`
  (3,278 jobs), all clean. The Phase 0 audit reported
  `EXPECTED_MEASUREMENTS=ok`; the Phase 1, 2, and 3 audits each reported
  `VERIFIED=1`.
- **Observation:** the accepted interfaces carry the slice, with two useful
  refinements exposed by the hostile cases.
  1. Pure information-local policies compile through `run` with histories as
     outcomes. Behavioral policies compile through `runBehavioral`, while the
     ordinary mixed extension of the pure form is definitionally `runMixed`.
     The two existing behavioral/mixed theorems commute with those forms under
     their sharp `ActsOnceWhereItMatters` and `ConstrainsAlike` hypotheses. The
     repeated-information-state counterexample still separates the forms when
     the first hypothesis fails.
  2. The old state-specialized `Context` could not express continuation values
     after two histories merge into one state. Generalizing the same two-field
     concept over its choice and outcome types lets `historyContext` retain the
     history without exposing it to a policy. Menu legality is now carried by
     the typed `Choice`; `IsOneShotOptimalWithin` is exactly
     `IsSequentiallyRationalAt` in these contexts at every history and remaining
     sub-horizon.
  3. Two expectation laws for support-dependent bind are the only new
     probability lemmas needed. Their branchwise monotonicity drives a
     finite-horizon induction: if every current typed choice is locally
     unimprovable, then every whole unilateral replacement policy is no better
     from every history. The from-start corollary is the ordinary static
     `IsNash` of `InformationModel.toGameForm`.
  4. The concrete repeated-vote endpoint is nonvacuous: the accepted profile
     has utility `1`, the down profile has utility `0`, arbitrary replacement
     policies satisfy the global bound, and the compiled profile is Nash.
     Source audits report zero sequential `Function.update`, transport,
     placeholders, and custom axioms. The fixed-player operations require
     decidable equality only for that player's information states.
- **Outcome:** supports and closes the finite-horizon composed-compiler and
  forward one-shot bridge. None of the kill conditions fired: no policy receives
  hidden execution state, no evaluator or equilibrium concept is duplicated,
  and no adequacy record or user-visible transport was introduced. The result
  deliberately does not claim a converse from initial static Nash, which cannot
  inspect off-path histories.
- **Next action:** the remaining sequential theorem is now sharply separate:
  define a genuine subgame-perfect/sequential-equilibrium target before asking
  for a well-founded `oneShotDeviation_iff_spe`. Do not present initial Nash as
  that target. The compiler, finite-horizon context equivalence, and forward
  global theorem are no longer blockers to the next architecture slice.

### EXP-026: kernel-checked finite LP certificates

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `389bfe8`
- **Decision / question:** D10/D12; whether `lp-verify`, `lp-tactic`, or neither
  earns a second external dependency by replacing EXP-007's explicit
  `norm_num` proofs while leaving certificate search outside the trusted base.
- **Representative slice:** first replay one closed rational inequality from
  Matching Pennies, then distinguish that concrete certificate result from the
  stronger claims of correlated-equilibrium feasibility and finite minimax.
- **Competing designs:** keep the current enumeration proofs; import the
  solver-free verifier and check an external certificate; import the tactic but
  provide certificates out of process; or add a solver backend as a separately
  measured dependency.
- **Measurements reserved before import:** toolchain and Mathlib skew; licenses
  of every transitive package; manifest disturbance; source and theorem axiom
  profile; `sorry`, `admit`, `unsafe`, `native_decide`, and FFI use; build jobs
  and platform requirements; import closure with positive and negative
  reachability probes; certificate size, elaboration time, and authored-proof
  reduction against the EXP-007 baseline.
- **Kill conditions:** any checked proof depends on a nonstandard axiom or
  compiler-trust shortcut; the verifier requires a native backend; the
  dependency leaks into Core, Protocol, or `Finite.Algorithm`; no compatible
  pinned revision exists; or the representative proof is not materially
  smaller or more maintainable than the current proof.
- **Evidence:** exact pins, source counts, commands, proof snippets, failed
  goals, and reachability results are preserved in
  [`experiments/EXP-026.md`](experiments/EXP-026.md); the interpretation is
  [`decisions/D13-lp-certificates.md`](decisions/D13-lp-certificates.md).
- **Observation:** trust and containment pass. The verifier, tactic, and
  pure-Lean backend compile on this project's `v4.32.0`; the verifier's tamper
  tests pass; all checked soundness and downstream theorems use only
  `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`; and fifteen negative
  reachability probes pass while three positive LP probes fire. The full
  solver-free/tactic/pure-backend candidate adds four Apache-2.0 packages,
  67 Lean files, 9,935 lines, and 49 downstream build jobs including the probe.
- **Disproof:** the representative game theorem does not become smaller.
  `by lp` cannot consume `uniformPennies_verify` before the explicit
  `pennyProfiles`/`sum_pennies` expansion, and after structural simplification
  it rejects the generated goal shape. It can prove the resulting closed
  inequality, but that replaces only the final `norm_num` line. A payoff
  parameter multiplied by an existential probability is rejected as nonlinear,
  so this stack does not by itself prove generic CE existence or minimax.
- **Outcome:** narrows. Kernel-checked LP certificates are admissible in
  principle, but the material-proof-reduction kill condition fired. No package,
  source root, manifest entry, or public API is accepted.
- **Next action:** keep the current EXP-007 proof. Reopen only with a concrete
  finite-game-to-`Problem` bridge plus one generic duality/feasibility theorem,
  or when a downstream theorem can consume a checked certificate without
  retaining the explicit enumeration proof it was meant to replace.

### EXP-027: Arrow through the canonical ranking vocabulary

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `7b184d0`
- **Decision / question:** D4 and Phase 5; whether Arrow's theorem can quantify
  over the accepted `Ranking` family and its named laws, rather than reviving
  the comparison design's separate `PrefRel` vocabulary or silently reinterpreting a weak
  comparison as a strict one.
- **Representative slice:** finite nonempty electorate, at least three
  alternatives, unrestricted profiles of linear weak rankings, collective
  rationality, strict Pareto, and IIA, through the Geanakoplos pivotal-voter
  proof to an exact dictator.
- **Competing designs:** prove directly with weak rankings; use
  `Rank.strict`/reflexive-closure as a private proof representation; or expose a
  second strict-ranking API.
- **Kill conditions:** a second public preference/profile/SWF type is needed;
  constructed profiles cannot be stated through the existing ranking laws;
  public statements must reinterpret argument orientation; or the proof pulls
  probability, game forms, topology, or executable finiteness into its authored
  surface.
- **Evidence:** the theorem inventory is
  `comparison corpus` at
  `the original measurement`; the adapted proof is
  `GameTheory/Core/Arrow.lean`, and the three-voter/three-alternative public
  witness is `GameTheory/Tests/Arrow.lean`. `lake build
  GameTheory.Tests.Arrow` completed in 842 jobs. `#print axioms
  GameTheory.Arrow.impossibility` reports only `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`. All four phase audits passed with their
  expected measurements and reachability probes; the final `lake build`
  completed cleanly in 3,281 jobs.
- **Observation:** the pivotal-voter proof reaches an exact dictator while its
  public domain remains `Ranking`, `Rank.Linear`, and `Rank.strict`; strict
  relations, profiles, and aggregators are private proof representations.
  Moving alternatives to the top or bottom and recovering the weak ranking
  require no second semantic type. The first closure probe did expose a real
  leftover defect: importing `SocialChoice` reached `FinDist` because all
  relation algebra still lived physically in `Preference.lean`. Moving that
  algebra to probability-free `Core/Rank.lean` reduced the Arrow target from
  1,715 to 842 jobs. After the repair, both `SocialChoice` and `Arrow` reject a
  `GameTheory.Math.Probability.FinDist` probe.
- **Outcome:** supports D4 with a physical-layer refinement. None of the
  semantic kill conditions fired, and the import-closure defect found by the
  stress test is repaired rather than documented away.
- **Next action:** treat Arrow as closed on this axis. Keep lottery operations
  in `Core/Preference.lean` and all carrier-generic ranking laws in
  `Core/Rank.lean`; proceed to the next Phase 5 stress theorem.

### EXP-028: Shapley value on the parallel coalitional primitive

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `0173c66`
- **Decision / question:** D0 and Phase 5; whether the accepted
  `CoalitionalGame` is sufficient for the Shapley value, its efficiency,
  symmetry, null-player, and additivity laws, and the theorem that those laws
  characterize it uniquely.
- **Representative slice:** finite explicitly enumerable agents, marginal
  contributions, unanimity games and their decomposition, the four Shapley
  axioms, uniqueness on every coalitional game, and the existing three-agent
  majority game as a concrete value calculation.
- **Competing designs:** define the value by weighted marginal contributions;
  average over arrival orders; or introduce extra linear/game-form structure
  and characterize through it.
- **Kill conditions:** the theorem needs strategies, outcomes, probability, or
  `GameForm`; a second coalitional-game or allocation type appears; finiteness
  must be stored in the game; the characterization requires a generic
  certificate hierarchy; or the majority-game witness cannot use the existing
  primitive unchanged.
- **Evidence:** the representative inventory is
  `comparison corpus`
  and `Shapley.lean` at
  `the original measurement`; the adapted construction and
  characterization are `GameTheory/Core/Shapley.lean`, and the discriminating
  endpoint is `GameTheory/Tests/Shapley.lean`. `lake build
  GameTheory.Tests.Shapley` completed in 1,070 jobs. Axiom checks for
  `shapleyValue_efficient` and `shapleyValue_characterization` report only
  `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`; `Shapley` rejects probes for
  `FinDist`, `GameForm`, and `Polynomial`. All four phase audits passed with
  their expected measurements and reachability probes; the final `lake build`
  completed cleanly in 3,283 jobs.
- **Observation:** the weighted marginal formula, four named rule properties,
  unanimity-basis decomposition, and uniqueness theorem all use the existing
  `CoalitionalGame` and `Allocation`. Explicit `Fintype` enumeration is needed
  by the value and theorems but is not stored in the game. The existing
  majority game is unchanged: its core is empty, its Shapley allocation pays
  each agent `1/3`, and every rule satisfying the four axioms agrees with it.
  The imported proof path is finite algebra only; probability, game forms,
  topology, and the analytic dependency remain unreachable.
- **Outcome:** supports D0's parallel-primitive decision. None of the kill
  conditions fired, and no new semantic wrapper or certificate hierarchy was
  introduced.
- **Next action:** treat the Shapley axis as closed and continue with the next
  Phase 5 stress theorem.

### EXP-029: Bayesian interim semantics through the information boundary

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `9233027`
- **Decision / question:** D0, D5, D6, and Phase 5; whether EXP-008's finite
  common-prior Bayesian form and genuinely interim deviation theorem can leave
  `Experimental`, while the same data compiles through the accepted
  `ExecutionProtocol`/`InformationModel` boundary without a second evaluator
  or equilibrium predicate.
- **Representative slice:** a finite Bayesian game with unstored finiteness
  assumptions; type-contingent plans compiled both directly to `GameForm` and
  through a two-step chance-then-simultaneous protocol whose policies see only
  their own type; exact policy/plan and play-law bridges; and one typed example
  exercising the interim theorem on the protocol-backed presentation.
- **Competing designs:** keep the static probe experimental; make Bayesian
  games a monolithic language module containing equilibrium theory; or split
  stable static data and interim theory from a solution-concept-free protocol
  compiler.
- **Kill conditions:** the protocol policy exposes the full type profile;
  `InformationModel` cannot express the own-type information set or its menu;
  a second Bayes-Nash/evaluation predicate is needed; finiteness must be stored
  in semantic data; the language compiler must import solution concepts; or
  the direct and protocol-induced outcome laws require user-visible transport.
- **Evidence:** `GameTheory/Core/Bayesian.lean` (53 nonblank lines),
  `GameTheory/Core/BayesianEquilibrium.lean` (117),
  `GameTheory/Languages/Bayesian.lean` (386), and
  `GameTheory/Tests/Bayesian.lean` (135). `lake build
  GameTheory.Tests.Bayesian` completed in 1,729 jobs; the final `lake build`
  completed cleanly in 3,287. All four phase audits passed. The Phase 3 audit
  now permanently rejects two solution-concept probes from the Bayesian
  compiler and positively reaches both Bayesian data and the information
  compiler. Axiom checks for `isNash_iff_interim`, `toProtocolForm_play`, and
  `truthful_protocol_isNash` report only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and
  `Quot.sound`.
- **Observation:** the data module stores no finiteness or decidable-equality
  capability; only the interim decomposition enumerates types. The separate
  equilibrium module promotes EXP-008's theorem without adding `BayesNash`.
  The solution-concept-free language module draws types at chance, exposes
  player `i` only to `View B i`, proves exact policy/plan equivalence, and
  identifies the two-step protocol law with the direct law mapped to completed
  outcomes. In the fair-bit endpoint, truth is interim-optimal and ordinary
  Nash in both presentations.
- **Outcome:** supports D0, D5, and D6 with a physical split. Bayesian games
  need coordinated static and information presentations, but no duplicate
  evaluator, preference, or equilibrium predicate; none of the kill conditions
  fired.
- **Next action:** treat the finite Bayesian axis as closed. Reserve a new
  experiment before starting repeated play or the predicted analytic bridge
  over Protocol.

### EXP-030: repeated play at the finite-prefix/infinite-value boundary

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `d044e1e`
- **Decision / question:** D0, D2, D11, D12, and Phase 5; whether public-action
  repeated games should be represented entirely as protocols, by native
  recursive stage paths plus a finite-prefix protocol compiler, or by a
  stochastic law over infinite histories.
- **Representative slice:** a generic public-action stage game; stationary and
  history-dependent repeated strategies; exact finite-prefix execution through
  `ExecutionProtocol`/`InformationModel`; normalized discounted payoff on the
  deterministic stage path; and the theorem that stationary repetition of a
  bounded stage Nash profile is ordinary Nash of the discounted repeated form.
- **Competing designs:** make Protocol the sole repeated-game representation;
  keep native recursive paths and prove a finite-prefix compiler law; or add an
  infinite-path probability carrier.
- **Kill conditions:** finite-prefix play needs a second transition or
  information interface; discounted equilibrium needs a repeated-specific Nash
  predicate; the stable theorem essentially quantifies over an infinite
  stochastic path law; the fixed-point dependency or measurable probability
  leaks into the stagewise root; or Protocol cannot express public observation
  of the accumulated action history without exposing hidden state.
- **Artifacts / commands:** `GameTheory/Repeated/{Basic,Discounted,Protocol}.lean`,
  `GameTheory/Repeated.lean`, `GameTheory/Tests/Repeated.lean`;
  `lake build GameTheory.Repeated` (1,759 jobs);
  `lake build GameTheory.Tests.Repeated` (1,760 jobs);
  `lake build` (3,292 jobs);
  `scripts/phase2-audit.ps1`; and
  `scripts/phase3-audit.ps1 -VerifyExpected`. The source inventory was
  `Concepts/Repeated/{Basic,Discounted}.lean`,
  `Languages/MultiRound/RepeatedGame.lean`, and
  `Concepts/Welfare/FolkTheorem/Main.lean` in the comparison corpus at
  `the original measurement`.
- **Observations / measurements:** the first candidate stored a dependent
  `Fin t → Profile` history. Equating it with a Protocol prefix immediately
  required proof-dependent transport, firing the kill condition. Replacing the
  canonical history by a chronological `List Profile` makes its length the
  period and lets native recursion and Protocol share the same state
  definitionally. The stable repeated root is 537 nonblank lines (Basic 125,
  Discounted 118, Protocol 280, root 14); the hostile test is 115. It contains
  zero source transport tokens and zero forbidden imports. Basic and Discounted
  reject all four `stdSimplex`/`Polynomial` probes. The three cross-layer
  rejection probes and both positive compiler-input probes pass. The compiler
  exactly reproduces a three-stage history-dependent path. Normalized discounted
  utility is a utility on the existing deterministic repeated form, and
  stationary repetition of a bounded stage Nash profile is ordinary `IsNash`;
  there is no repeated-specific equilibrium predicate and no infinite-path
  `FinDist`. Both flagship paths use only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and
  `Quot.sound`.
- **Outcome:** supports the native-path/finite-prefix compiler design and D11's
  boundary; narrows public repeated histories to chronological lists. Protocol
  is reused for finite execution and information, not made the sole
  infinite-horizon representation. This experiment does not validate the full
  folk theorem's simplex-approximation geometry.
- **Next action:** reserve a separate experiment before importing or rebuilding
  the full folk-theorem mathematics. Compete a repeated-analysis bridge against
  keeping that geometry inside the stable repeated root, with negative probes
  from `GameTheory.Repeated` and positive probes from any new bridge.

### EXP-031: dependency home for the discounted folk theorem

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `681be12`
- **Decision / question:** D11, D12, and Phase 5; whether the full discounted
  folk theorem's feasible-payoff geometry and simplex approximation belong in
  the stable `GameTheory.Repeated` root, in `GameTheory.Analysis`, or in a new
  one-way analytic bridge over repeated play.
- **Representative slice:** the representative theorem
  `KernelGame.discounted_folk_theorem_approx`: approximate a feasible payoff
  strictly above every opponent-security level by normalized discounted payoff
  vectors of history-dependent Nash profiles. Preserve its deterministic
  `ℕ`-indexed stage path and ordinary Nash reading.
- **Competing designs:** import the required general mathematics directly into
  stable Repeated; place the theorem under `GameTheory.Analysis.Repeated`,
  importing only Basic/Discounted plus the existing analytic payoff/minimax
  interfaces; or introduce a separate `GameTheory.Repeated.Analysis` bridge
  root with its own reachability budget.
- **Kill conditions:** the stable repeated root starts reaching
  `stdSimplex`/`Polynomial`; the theorem needs a second payoff, mixed-game,
  security, or equilibrium definition; any candidate needs a stochastic law
  over the entire infinite path; the bridge must import Protocol despite using
  no finite execution semantics; or the borrowed geometry costs more or exposes
  more transport than a focused greenfield lemma.
- **Evidence:** the source inventory was
  `Concepts/Welfare/FolkTheorem/{Geometry,Periodic,Trigger,Main}.lean`,
  `Concepts/ZeroSum/SecurityStrategy.lean`, and
  `Math/SimplexApproximation.lean` in the comparison corpus at
  `the original measurement`.
- **Pre-implementation measurement:** the eight apparent the baseline support files total
  2,324 nonblank lines. Of those, the 255-line ambient/interior `Geometry.lean`
  contributes no declaration used by the flagship, and the 328-line general
  security file is imported only for a narrower opponent-minmax construction
  already developed inside `Feasible.lean`. The required denominator-clearing
  lemma is a 134-line game-independent file and has no Mathlib equivalent in the
  dependency. Greenfield Analysis currently provides the finite-law
  simplex equivalence, mixed-profile polytope, mixed payoff polynomial, Nash
  existence, and two-player zero-sum minimax. The last two do not directly
  express an `n`-player game against a coalition, so forcing reuse would change
  the punishment value rather than remove duplication. Stable Repeated rejects
  all four `stdSimplex`/`Polynomial` probes; `Analysis.Payoff` reaches both.
- **Selection tested:** place general denominator clearing in the
  independent `GameTheory.Math` target; keep continuation, periodic-path, and
  trigger incentive results in stable Repeated; place feasible-payoff convex
  geometry, opponent-minmax construction, and the existence/approximation
  theorem under `GameTheory.Analysis.Repeated`. Reject
  `GameTheory.Repeated.Analysis`, because directory membership would make the
  audited stable root own the analytic surface. The bridge must import
  Basic/Discounted directly, not the Repeated umbrella, and must not import
  Protocol.
- **Artifacts / commands:** `GameTheory/Math/SimplexApproximation.lean`;
  `GameTheory/Repeated/{Discounted,Periodic,Trigger}.lean`;
  `GameTheory/Analysis/Repeated/{Feasible,Folk,Examples}.lean`;
  `GameTheory/Analysis/Repeated.lean`; `lake build
  GameTheory.Analysis.Repeated.Folk` (1,835 jobs); `lake build
  GameTheory.Analysis.Repeated` (1,844); `lake build
  GameTheory.Analysis.Repeated.Examples` (1,850); and
  `lake build` (3,302); all four phase audits, including
  `scripts/phase2-audit.ps1 -VerifyExpected`.
- **Observations / measurements:** the resulting stable Repeated root is 1,468
  nonblank lines, the analytic repeated subtree including its witness and root
  is 783, and independent `GameTheory.Math` is 185. All three source buckets
  contain zero transport tokens; `GameTheory.Math` imports no game or
  fixed-point module. `GameTheory.Repeated` still rejects both `stdSimplex` and
  `Polynomial` (six negative probes across Basic, Discounted, and the public
  root). The bridge positively reaches the trigger profile, opponent-minmax
  vector, and residual-floor counts, while rejecting `ExecutionProtocol`;
  `GameTheory.Math.SimplexApproximation` rejects `UtilityGame`. No second mixed
  form, payoff evaluator, security hierarchy, equilibrium predicate, or
  infinite-path law was needed. The Prisoner's Dilemma witness proves mutual
  cooperation feasible, permanent defection bounds every mixed best response
  by one, and patient repeated Nash payoffs approach three. The flagship,
  trigger theorem, cycle approximation, and witness use only `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- **Outcome:** supports the one-way `GameTheory.Analysis.Repeated` bridge and
  the independent `GameTheory.Math` target. None of the kill conditions fired.
  The unused ambient/interior geometry and general security hierarchy were not
  ported.
- **Next action:** treat the deterministic discounted folk-theorem axis as
  closed. Sequential equilibrium remains a separate predicted D12
  renegotiation because its topology sits over Protocol strategy objects.

### EXP-032: analytic boundary for sequential equilibrium

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `fa5bc1e`
- **Decision / question:** D6, D12, and Phase 5; whether pointwise
  Kreps-Wilson consistency should put topology inside Protocol, stay a generic
  user-supplied convergence predicate there, or live in a one-way analytic
  bridge over Protocol.
- **Representative slice:** the finite-information assessment interface over
  behavioral policies and history beliefs; fully mixed approximating
  assessments satisfying Bayes consistency; pointwise convergence to a target
  assessment; and the conjunction with the existing
  sequential-rationality predicate.
- **Competing designs:** import topology into
  `GameTheory.Protocol.Assessment`; keep only a predicate-parameterized limit
  schema in Protocol and define pointwise convergence in
  `GameTheory.Analysis.Protocol`; or specialize the whole notion to a language
  such as EFG under an analytic language bridge.
- **Kill conditions:** Protocol starts reaching `stdSimplex`, `Polynomial`, or
  topology-only constants; policies or beliefs require a second representation;
  the analytic bridge must expose hidden execution state to policies; the
  existing assessment/sequential-rationality API cannot state the rational half
  unchanged; or pointwise convergence needs measurable path probability rather
  than finite-coordinate topology.
- **Evidence:**
  1. The pinned generic assessment, EFG adapter, and convergence helper contain
     406, 560, and 49 nonblank lines respectively. Their topology is isolated
     in the convergence helper; most of the generic file is assessment,
     support, Bayes, and rationality plumbing already represented differently
     by current Protocol.
  2. A pre-import probe after `import GameTheory.Protocol` found
     `TopologicalSpace`, `nhds`, `Filter.Tendsto`, `Continuous`, and
     `Metric.tendsto_atTop` already reachable through Mathlib dependencies.
     Raw topology-name absence therefore cannot enforce this boundary.
     GameTheory declaration probes can: Protocol rejects both
     `FinDistConvergesPointwise` and `IsSequentiallyConsistent`, while the
     bridge positively reaches stable sequential rationality, finite Bayes
     consistency, and its pointwise convergence definition.
  3. The first assessment carrier was refuted before the gate. A raw
     `InfoState` value need not be produced by any history, so requiring a
     `FinDist` over its empty history fiber could make the whole assessment
     type uninhabited. `InformationSite` now pairs an information-state value
     with a nonempty history fiber. `BehavioralAssessment.ofStrategy` proves
     every existing behavioral strategy admits an assessment. Beliefs remain
     over histories, because two histories can merge into one execution state;
     `stateBelief_onInfoSet` projects them to the existing state-level
     `BeliefOn` predicate.
  4. The stable addition is 142 nonblank lines in
     `Protocol/BehavioralAssessment.lean` plus the six-line
     `FinDist.FullSupport` interface. The analytic subtree is 188 nonblank
     lines: pointwise strategy and belief convergence, fully mixed and Bayes
     approximants, sequential consistency/equilibrium, and a Boolean tremble
     witness. Fully mixed laws converge there to a pure law, so the topology is
     load-bearing rather than decorative. No second policy, runner,
     state-belief, local-optimality, or equilibrium semantics was introduced.
  5. The narrow bridge build completed in 1,768 jobs. Phase 2 reports zero
     Analysis imports outside its root, one fixed-point importer, zero
     Analysis transport, and all six stable reachability probes passing.
     Phase 3 reports zero forbidden Protocol imports and transport, two
     Protocol-to-Analysis rejections, three positive bridge inputs, and two
     rejected fixed-point-geometry probes. The full build completed in 3,306
     jobs and all four phase audits pass. Axiom checks for the history-to-state
     belief projection, tremble convergence, and convergence projection use
     only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- **Outcome:** supports a second one-way bridge,
  `GameTheory.Analysis.Protocol`. Stable Protocol owns reachable information
  sites, behavioral assessments, history-supported beliefs, finite Bayes
  consistency, and predicate-parametric limit consistency; the bridge owns
  pointwise topology and its Kreps-Wilson specialization. The raw
  topology-name subcondition was already true at baseline, so it refuted
  vocabulary absence as an enforcement design rather than the bridge; no
  semantic kill condition fired. The experiment validates this presentation
  and dependency direction; it does not claim an EFG compiler or a
  sequential-equilibrium existence theorem.
- **Next action:** treat the generic sequential-consistency boundary as
  closed. Reserve a separate language spike before adapting the pinned
  560-line EFG layer; that compiler must supply continuation contexts and
  finite information-site fibers rather than widening this bridge in advance.
- **Post-experiment correction (EXP-033):** the EFG hostile slice narrowed two
  stable claims without changing this boundary result. A nonempty history fiber
  does not by itself make an information state a decision site: reached chance,
  inactive, and terminal observations need no assessment belief.
  `InformationSite` now also witnesses a nonterminal history and a genuine
  action in the local menu.
  Moreover, local-law optimality is not sequential rationality without a proved
  one-shot-deviation principle. The generic predicate now compares whole
  continuation behavioral policies; a future local-law specialization must
  prove that reduction.

### EXP-033: finite EFG adapter for sequential assessments

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `4db0eb9`
- **Decision / question:** D6, D12, and Phase 5; whether a finite
  extensive-form language can compile through the accepted general-state
  Protocol and instantiate EXP-032's assessment boundary without creating
  parallel policy, evaluator, belief, rationality, or equilibrium semantics.
- **Representative slice:** a finite single-mover tree with chance and two
  distinct decision histories in one information set; compilation to
  `ExecutionProtocol` and `InformationModel`; finite information-site fibers;
  a behavioral assessment and its history-supported belief; and the
  language-specific continuation contexts consumed by
  `IsSequentialEquilibriumFor`.
- **Competing designs:** expose `Protocol.Tree` plus information labels as the
  language; define independent recursive EFG syntax and prove a compiler
  correct; or reject a generic EFG layer and keep sequential assessments
  protocol-native.
- **Kill conditions:** EFG syntax imports a solution concept or
  `GameTheory.Analysis`; compilation introduces a second runner or policy
  representation; finite information-site instances require
  `Fintype.ofFinite`, user-visible transport, or proof-heavy public casts; a
  policy can recover hidden execution state; continuation contexts cannot reuse
  `Context.IsLocallyOptimal`; or the adapter needs measurable path probability.
- **Evidence:**
  1. The pinned `Languages/EFG/Syntax.lean` and `Sequential.lean` contain 452
     and 560 nonblank lines. The current finite `Protocol.Tree` has neither
     information labels nor a law identifying actions at two nodes in one
     information set. Adding those fields would build a second information and
     policy presentation before it supplied any new semantics.
  2. The winning presentation is therefore a transparent specialization:
     `Languages/EFG.lean` is 52 nonblank lines and stores exactly an
     `ExecutionProtocol`, its `InformationModel`, tree-shapedness, and the
     single-mover law. It defines no recursive syntax, transition, runner,
     policy, payoff, belief, or equilibrium. Finiteness is supplied by the
     theorem that needs it rather than stored in the game.
  3. The 300-line hostile test has a nondegenerate chance step, two distinct
     decision histories carrying different hidden Boolean states, and one
     shared `acting` information state. Its belief gives both histories positive
     support. The execution state records the full position, so tree-shapedness
     is proved rather than obtained by merging histories or proof irrelevance;
     the player's view still cannot recover nature's bit.
  4. The test refuted two assumptions inherited from EXP-032. First, a reached
     raw information state may describe chance, inactivity, or termination, so
     assessments now range only over reached decision sites with a witnessed
     nonterminal history and `some action` in the menu. This explicit
     nonterminal witness matters because Protocol deliberately leaves `active`
     unconstrained after play stops. Second, changing only the law at the
     current information state is not a general sequential deviation.
     `IsSequentiallyRationalAt` now compares the player's whole
     `BehavioralPolicy`, and `continuationContext` runs that replacement from a
     history sampled by the assessment belief. A one-shot reduction, if wanted,
     is a theorem with its own hypotheses rather than definitional semantics.
  5. Tree-shapedness gives an explicit equivalence between complete histories
     and reachable states. A finite state carrier therefore supplies
     `Fintype History` through `Fintype.ofEquiv`; the source uses no
     `Fintype.ofFinite`, direct `Function.update`, visible transport, custom
     axiom, or placeholder. The analytic EFG adapter is 63 nonblank lines and
     only supplies these finite instances plus the canonical continuation
     contexts to the generic Protocol predicate.
  6. The analytic adapter plus hostile test build completed in 1,771 jobs. An
     initial placement under `GameTheory/Tests` made Phase 2 report
     `ANALYSIS_IMPORTED_OUTSIDE_ROOT=1`; moving the same integration witness to
     `GameTheory/Analysis/Protocol/EFGTest.lean` restored zero without weakening
     the audit. Phase 3 reports zero forbidden Protocol or Languages imports
     and zero transport. Stable EFG syntax rejects three solution or analysis
     probes while positively reaching all three semantic inputs; the analytic
     adapter positively reaches all three bridge inputs.
  7. The full build completed in 3,309 jobs and all four phase audits pass.
     Axiom checks for the mixture-support lemma, history equivalence and
     enumeration, hostile tree proof, and EFG adapter theorem use only
     `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- **Outcome:** supports the transparent specialization and closes the finite
  presentation gate. No independent EFG syntax/compiler survived the
  competition: the language object is a named bundle of the canonical Protocol
  semantics and structural laws, and the analytic adapter is one-way. The
  experiment validates that an imperfect-information assessment and the full
  sequential-equilibrium proposition can be stated on this carrier. It does
  not prove that the exhibited assessment is consistent or rational, and it
  proves neither a concrete sequential equilibrium nor an existence theorem.
- **Next action:** reserve a theorem spike for an actual finite-EFG sequential
  equilibrium witness or existence result. Broad harvesting of the pinned EFG
  theorem surface remains gated on that mathematical slice rather than on more
  presentation machinery.

### EXP-034: concrete sequential equilibrium on the hostile finite EFG

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `adf1acc`
- **Decision / question:** D6, D12, and the finite EFG theorem gate; whether the
  EXP-033 hidden-information carrier supports a proved sequential-equilibrium
  assessment, not merely a well-typed target.
- **Representative slice:** the same fair hidden Boolean chance move and shared
  decision information set; a fully mixed behavioral policy, the conditional
  belief induced by reach probability, sequential consistency, and
  full-continuation-policy rationality for an explicit payoff.
- **Competing designs:** prove the constant fully mixed assessment directly;
  first extract the generic theorem that a fully mixed Bayes-consistent
  assessment is sequentially consistent and instantiate it; or retreat to a
  simpler perfect-information witness if the hostile Bayes denominator cannot
  be controlled without new semantics.
- **Kill conditions:** the proof needs a second path-probability definition,
  hand-asserted consistency, measurable infinite paths, an EFG-specific
  equilibrium predicate, `native_decide`, a custom axiom, or a representation
  change merely to normalize the finite Bayes calculation.
- **Evidence:**
  1. Stable Protocol now constructs `bayesBelief` by normalizing the existing
     `historyReachProbability` weights at any finite positive-mass information
     site. Its probability theorem is definitionally the quotient already used
     by `IsBayesConsistentAt`; no second path law or conditional-belief
     predicate was introduced.
  2. Two generic reductions keep the EFG proof honest and small at the semantic
     boundary. Zero continuation payoff makes every whole replacement policy
     sequentially rational. A fully mixed, finite-Bayes-consistent assessment
     is sequentially consistent via the constant approximating sequence, using
     pointwise convergence of constant finite laws.
  3. The hostile carrier's fully mixed policy maps the fair coin into both
     decision actions and has full support at every genuine information site.
     The actual one-step behavioral runner assigns each hidden decision history
     probability `1 / 2`; this is proved through the canonical randomized
     chooser and runner, not asserted by a second evaluator. One such history
     proves the information mass is positive.
  4. The resulting assessment uses `bayesBelief` at every site, proves finite
     Bayes consistency, then proves `game.IsSequentiallyConsistent` and
     `game.IsSequentialEquilibriumWithin ... payoff 2`. The payoff is
     identically zero, so this slice deliberately makes the Bayes/consistency
     path hostile while keeping the rationality calculation transparent.
  5. The narrow analytic EFG test build completed in 1,770 jobs. Source scans
     find no `Fintype.ofFinite`, direct `Function.update`, transport, custom
     axiom, placeholder, or `native_decide`. Axiom checks for the Bayes
     constructor, zero-payoff rationality, constant-sequence consistency,
     one-step reach calculation, and final equilibrium theorem use only
     `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
  6. A first direct normalization proof used four `change` tactic tokens, and
     Phase 2 rejected it with `TRANSPORT_ANALYSIS_SOURCE=4`. Rewriting the same
     definitional steps with typed goals restored the enforced value to zero;
     no audit allowance changed. The full build completed in 3,309 jobs and all
     four phase audits pass.
- **Outcome:** supports. The same chance/imperfect-information EFG used to
  validate the adapter now has a kernel-checked sequential-equilibrium witness.
  The result exercises full support, the real behavioral runner, positive
  information mass, Bayes normalization, pointwise consistency, and the
  generic EFG predicate. It is a concrete existence witness, not a general
  finite-EFG existence theorem; zero payoff means it does not yet stress a
  nonconstant continuation calculation.
- **Next action:** the presentation gate is no longer blocking theorem
  recovery. Begin a measured harvest of the pinned finite-EFG theorem inventory,
  with the first nonconstant-payoff or one-shot result kept as the next hostile
  check on whole-policy rationality.

### EXP-035: nonconstant-payoff rationality on the hostile finite EFG

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `f23e3ef`
- **Status:** complete
- **Decision / question:** D6, D12, and delivery gate W1-A; whether the
  EXP-034 fully mixed Bayes assessment is sequentially rational for a
  nonconstant payoff that depends on nature's hidden bit and the player's
  action, using the generic whole-policy continuation context.
- **Hypothesis:** on the fair hidden-bit game, payoff one for matching the
  hidden bit and zero otherwise gives every information-local action law value
  `1 / 2`. The fully mixed assessment is therefore sequentially rational even
  against an arbitrary replacement behavioral policy, while the existing
  Bayes/consistency proof remains unchanged.
- **Representative slice:** define the matching payoff on terminal histories;
  calculate the continuation value from both hidden decision histories through
  `runBehavioralFrom`; average through the canonical Bayes belief; prove
  `IsSequentiallyRationalWithin` for every whole replacement policy; combine it
  with EXP-034 consistency into an EFG sequential equilibrium.
- **Competing designs:** prove the arbitrary-policy value formula directly on
  the existing continuation context; first expose a reusable fair-hidden-state
  expectation lemma; or, if the explicit finite calculation reveals missing
  structure, record the smallest honest assessment/payoff interface change
  before broad EFG harvesting.
- **Kill conditions:** the proof needs an EFG-specific rationality predicate, a
  second evaluator or path-probability law, access to the hidden state through
  the policy, hand-asserted belief probabilities, measurable infinite paths,
  `native_decide`, a custom axiom, or a transport/audit exception.
- **Planned artifacts / commands:**
  `GameTheory/Analysis/Protocol/EFGTest.lean`;
  `lake build GameTheory.Analysis.Protocol.EFGTest`;
  `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/phase2-audit.ps1 -VerifyExpected`;
  `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/phase3-audit.ps1 -VerifyExpected`;
  focused axiom and source audits.
- **Evidence:**
  1. `matchingPayoff` pays one exactly when the terminal action equals nature's
     hidden bit. `runBehavioralFrom_decision_matchingPayoff` evaluates that
     payoff through the canonical randomized history runner for an arbitrary
     whole replacement policy. Projecting the dependent legal `Choice` to
     `Option Bool` was sufficient; no policy receives the hidden state.
  2. The history fiber at the acting information state is proved equivalent to
     `Bool` from reachability and tree-shaped trace uniqueness. Consequently
     the existing reach calculation proves the information mass is exactly
     one, and `fullyMixedAssessment_belief_acting` identifies the canonical
     normalized `bayesBelief` with the explicit fair two-history mixture. No
     belief probability is asserted separately.
  3. `continuationContext_matchingPayoff_value` proves value `1 / 2` for every
     replacement behavioral policy. The two hidden states contribute
     complementary action indicators, so legality of the acting menu and total
     probability mass close the calculation without enumerating a particular
     strategy.
  4. The generic whole-policy predicate then proves
     `fullyMixedAssessment_isSequentiallyRationalWithin_matchingPayoff`; the
     unchanged EXP-034 consistency theorem yields
     `fullyMixedAssessment_isSequentialEquilibrium_matchingPayoff`.
  5. `lake build GameTheory.Analysis.Protocol.EFGTest` completed in 1,770 jobs.
     All four phase audits pass their expected measurements. In particular,
     `TRANSPORT_ANALYSIS_SOURCE=0`, `SORRY_OR_ADMIT=0`,
     `CUSTOM_AXIOM=0`, all EFG syntax/bridge probes retain their expected
     direction, and a focused source scan finds none of the experiment's
     forbidden tokens.
  6. Axiom checks for the branch calculation, exact information mass, Bayes
     belief identification, arbitrary-policy value theorem, and final
     sequential equilibrium use only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and
     `Quot.sound`.
- **Outcome:** supports. Nonconstant payoff and Bayes consistency now coexist
  on the same hostile chance/imperfect-information EFG, and rationality holds
  against arbitrary whole replacement policies through the accepted generic
  continuation context. None of the kill conditions fired; W1-A is complete.
- **Next action:** use this fixed rationality target to close W1-B's public SPE
  and full well-founded one-shot-deviation semantics before broad finite-EFG
  equilibrium harvesting.

### EXP-036: well-founded information-local one-shot deviation iff SPE

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `f23e3ef`
- **Status:** complete
- **Decision / question:** D6 and delivery gate W1-B; whether the accepted
  execution/information split supports a public strategic subgame-perfect
  predicate and a full one-shot-deviation equivalence without returning to
  the comparison design's syntax-recursive EFG evaluator.
- **Hypothesis:** lift `WellFoundedPlay` from states to complete histories and
  define terminal continuation value by well-founded recursion on history
  extension. Subgame perfection can then quantify, for every player and every
  history including off-path histories, over arbitrary replacement
  information-local policies. Under `ActsOnceWhereItMatters`, this is
  equivalent to the existing typed one-choice deviation followed by the
  original profile.
- **Representative slice:** a stable Protocol theorem over an arbitrary
  `InformationModel`; multi-player utility, arbitrary whole-policy deviations,
  every complete history, and a local replacement choice at each nonterminal
  history. Exercise both directions on a finite tree-shaped EFG with an
  explicitly off-path decision history.
- **Competing designs:** port the comparison design's recursive `GameTree`/subtree predicate;
  expose the existing single-controller state-chooser theorem under an SPE
  name; retain only the finite-horizon forward theorem; or add the
  history-level well-founded strategic theorem and keep the finite EFG layer a
  transparent specialization.
- **Kill conditions:** the result calls a controller optimum SPE, quantifies
  only from the initial history, assumes finite outcomes or a uniform numeric
  horizon, requires a second transition/evaluation law, lets a policy inspect
  hidden execution state, imports Analysis into Protocol, needs transport or
  `Function.update`, or cannot prove the converse under the exact no-revisit
  condition already used by the representation theorem.
- **Planned artifacts / commands:**
  `GameTheory/Protocol/SubgamePerfect.lean`;
  a focused Protocol/EFG probe;
  `lake build GameTheory.Protocol.SubgamePerfect`;
  phase 2 and phase 3 audits; focused source and axiom checks.
- **Evidence:**
  1. `HistorySuccessor` is the inverse image of the accepted state successor
     relation under `History.state`, so `WellFoundedPlay` lifts without a new
     path order. `historyBackwardValue` recurses on complete histories while
     every recursive call is still justified by a realized step in the
     canonical transition law.
  2. `historyBackwardValue_eq_expect_runHistoryFor` proves that the new
     well-founded view equals the existing forward history runner wherever the
     latter has stopped. This is the same semantic join used by state-level
     `backwardValue`; no second transition or path-probability law was added.
  3. `InformationModel.IsSubgamePerfect` quantifies over every player, every
     arbitrary whole replacement policy, and every complete history.
     `HasNoProfitableOneShotDeviation` changes one typed legal choice and then
     returns to the original profile. Both use player-specific terminal
     utility, not a controller optimum.
  4. The forward implication is well-founded induction over histories. The
     converse uses `Policy.replaceAt` plus `ActsOnceWhereItMatters` to prove the
     persistent replacement is observationally invisible after the first
     step. The public iff assumes neither finite outcomes, a uniform numeric
     horizon, perfect information syntax, nor bounded utility.
  5. The finite perfect-information probe has an incumbent that exits
     immediately and is optimal against every whole replacement policy from
     the initial history. A legal later decision history is proved absent from
     the incumbent run support, yet rewarding there is worth one and the
     incumbent's punishment is worth zero. The profile therefore fails SPE
     exactly because of an off-path profitable one-shot deviation. The probe
     also specializes both directions of the generic iff.
  6. The focused build completed in 1,732 jobs and the full build in 3,311
     jobs. Phase 2 and Phase 3 audits pass with
     `TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL=0`, `FUNCTION_UPDATE_SEQUENTIAL=0`,
     `SORRY_OR_ADMIT_SEQUENTIAL=0`, `CUSTOM_AXIOM_SEQUENTIAL=0`, and all
     boundary/reachability probes unchanged. Phase 0 and Phase 1 audits also
     retain their expected measurements.
  7. Axiom checks for the forward-run join, both implications, the iff, initial
     optimality, and off-path rejection use only `propext`,
     `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- **Outcome:** supports. The accepted Protocol layer carries an honest
  well-founded strategic SPE predicate and the full one-shot-deviation
  equivalence, including off-path histories. None of the kill conditions
  fired; W1-B and the frozen F4 semantic theorem are complete.
- **Next action:** keep any EFG syntax wrapper thin during L-EFG harvesting,
  and move the Wave 1 critical path to F2 no-regret-to-CCE and F8 stochastic
  monitoring while T1 proceeds independently.

### EXP-037: incomparable MAID decisions without false serialization

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `eb17f87`
- **Status:** complete
- **Decision / question:** D6, D14, and the L-MAID/T3 delivery gate; whether a
  MAID with two causally incomparable decision nodes can compile to the
  accepted execution/information layer without asserting that either decision
  precedes the other.
- **Hypothesis, recorded before implementation:** compile the current minimal
  frontier as one Protocol step. Incomparable decisions are then simultaneous
  active players whose joint action advances the frontier once. Each policy
  sees common resolved parents but neither decision sees the other's current
  action. The exact terminal outcome law should equal direct evaluation of both
  decision rules under the shared chance law.
- **Representative slice:** one nondegenerate Boolean chance node; two Boolean
  decision nodes owned by different agents, both observing chance and
  incomparable with each other; one utility node depending nontrivially on both
  decisions. The hostile tests must show that both players are active at the
  same history, each decision changes the law, observation matters, and there
  is no intermediate state in which only one decision has been recorded.
- **Competing designs:** serialize an arbitrary topological order while hiding
  the first action from the second policy; batch the antichain frontier into a
  simultaneous joint step; or keep the concrete linear MAID and reject a
  general public MAID until a different execution representation exists.
- **Kill conditions:** any fake player or padding action beyond Protocol's
  canonical `none`; a state that records one incomparable decision before the
  other; a policy that can inspect the other current action or hidden execution
  state; a second evaluator; outcome-law dependence on an arbitrary order;
  transport/audit exceptions; or a public API frozen before the hostile slice
  and D14 measurement are complete.
- **Planned artifacts / commands:**
  `GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/MAIDIncomparable.lean`;
  `lake build GameTheory.Experimental.PostArchitecture.MAIDIncomparable`;
  source and axiom audits; full phase audits if the spike is promoted.
- **Evidence:**
  1. The 406-nonblank-line experimental module has 58 declarations, all under
     `GameTheory.Experimental`; no stable declaration or import changed. Its
     only authored import is `GameTheory.Protocol.Information`. The generated
     project import graph has six prerequisites: `FinDist`, Execution,
     Extraction, History, Randomized, and Information; it reaches no language,
     solution-concept, or Analysis root.
  2. At `.chanceKnown signal`, both source agents are active and one legal joint
     transition records both decisions. The state type has no constructor for
     a partially recorded frontier, and `decisions_commit_together` proves
     every supported target contains both choices.
  3. Policies receive only the shared resolved chance parent. The compiled
     three-step information-local run is proved equal to the direct law; no
     second transition or evaluator was introduced.
  4. Separate hostile theorems prove that changing either decision changes the
     outcome law and that observing the common parent raises expected payoff
     from one to two. The slice is therefore not validated by a vacuous or
     policy-insensitive diagram.
  5. The focused target builds in 1,718 jobs. Source scans report zero
     `sorry`, `admit`, `native_decide`, direct `Function.update`, transport
     tokens, `HEq`, or tactic `change`.
  6. Axiom checks for the run law, simultaneous-commit theorem, and all three
     outcome-dependence theorems use only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and
     `Quot.sound`.
  7. The full build completes in 3,326 jobs. Phase 0, Phase 1, Phase 2, and
     Phase 3 audits pass with their expected measurements and reachability
     probes. The first Phase 2 run correctly rejected the new file as
     unbucketed; the audit now gives post-architecture experiments an explicit
     zero-transport budget instead of silently folding them into a historical
     phase.
- **Outcome:** supports. Frontier batching passes the hostile incomparable-node
  gate without a fake order, fake player, padding action, hidden-state policy,
  transport exception, or new runner. D14 adopts it as the compilation
  invariant for general MAID work. This fixed antichain is evidence for the
  design, not an implementation of arbitrary finite DAG syntax or T3.
- **Next action:** inventory T3 at declaration level, then implement the
  smallest general finite-DAG MAID whose frontier compiler specializes to this
  slice before proving the named MAID-to-EFG laws.

### EXP-038: same-owner incomparable decisions

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `2964804`
- **Status:** complete
- **Decision / question:** D6, D14, and T3; whether one Protocol action and
  information state per source player can batch multiple incomparable
  decision sites without letting one site depend on another site's private
  parents.
- **Hypothesis, recorded before implementation:** naive per-player batching is
  too permissive. If one player owns two incomparable decisions, the left site
  observes only a left chance bit, and the right site observes only a right
  chance bit, a combined frontier view exposes both bits while choosing both
  actions. It therefore admits a cross-reading action pair that no pair of
  native local decision rules can implement.
- **Representative slice:** two independent Boolean chance parents; one player;
  two incomparable Boolean decisions with disjoint singleton observation
  sets; a candidate compiled policy returning the other site's observed bit at
  each decision. Prove that no `leftRule : Bool → Bool` and
  `rightRule : Bool → Bool` agrees with this policy on all four parent
  assignments.
- **Competing designs:** restrict stable MAIDs so a player's decisions are
  ancestry-comparable; add a named locality certificate around batched
  per-player actions; index Protocol actors by decision sites and regroup
  deviations by owner; or keep order-free frontier evaluation native and
  translate to a serialized EFG whose information sets hide incomparable
  actions, proving the result independent of the chosen topological order.
- **Kill conditions:** calling the combined view information-local without a
  proof; admitting a target EFG strategy with no native counterpart; treating
  decision sites as source players in equilibrium statements; weakening the
  frozen T3 claim silently; or freezing general syntax before the mismatch is
  resolved.
- **Evidence:**
  1. `GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/MAIDSameOwner.lean` defines
     native policies as site-indexed local Boolean rules and the naive compiled
     policy as a function from the combined parent view to both actions.
  2. `crossReading` sends each action to the parent observed only by the other
     site. Both dependence theorems are nonvacuous, while native left and right
     noninterference are definitional equalities.
  3. `crossReading_not_representable` proves no native local policy maps to
     that compiled policy. Thus the combined-view target is strictly larger,
     not merely presented differently.
  4. The slice is 68 nonblank lines and 13 declarations, imports no GameTheory
     module, builds in 105 jobs, and has zero placeholder, native-decision,
     direct-update, or transport tokens.
  5. Axiom checks for non-representability and both native noninterference laws
     report no axioms.
  6. The integrated full build completes in 3,329 jobs, and Phase 2/3 boundary,
     trust, and reachability audits retain their expected values.
- **Outcome:** refutes naive per-player frontier compilation. EXP-037 remains
  valid as an execution-law result for a distinct-owner antichain, but its
  combined information view cannot generalize to arbitrary MAIDs.
- **Next action:** keep site-local policy in the native typed-DAG semantics and
  use its order-free frontier evaluation as the reference law. Translate to an
  explicitly ordered EFG whose decision information hides all incomparable
  assignments, then prove outcome order independence and a true strategy
  correspondence. Do not expose a general frontier `InformationModel`.

### EXP-039: capability-parametric finite DAG substrate

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `2964804`
- **Status:** complete
- **Decision / question:** D9, D14, and T3; whether the reusable DAG fragment
  needed by general MAIDs can be recovered as game-independent mathematics
  without storing `Fintype`/`DecidableEq` in semantic graph data or fixing the
  public node carrier to `Fin n`.
- **Hypothesis, recorded before implementation:** define acyclicity for any
  relation and a topological-order certificate for any predecessor function.
  Require finite enumeration only on the theorem that constructs an order.
  The predecessor's well-founded construction should generalize from `Fin n`
  to an arbitrary finite carrier while its MAID-specific API is discarded.
- **Representative slice:** a four-node diamond with two incomparable middle
  nodes. Derive a topological order from acyclicity and prove every direct and
  transitive predecessor occurs earlier.
- **Competing designs:** port the pinned `Fin n` API; store an explicit rank or
  order inside every MAID; use an arbitrary node carrier with an acyclic
  predecessor relation and derive an order under operation-local finite
  capabilities; or find an existing Mathlib theorem.
- **Mathlib search:** local source search found undirected
  `SimpleGraph.IsAcyclic` but no directed topological-order construction for a
  finite predecessor relation.
- **Kill conditions:** game imports in the reusable module; finiteness stored in
  graph semantic data; user-visible transport through an equivalence with
  `Fin n`; a custom axiom; or inability to recover parent-before-child and
  ancestor-before-descendant facts on the diamond.
- **Evidence:**
  1. `GameTheory/Math/DAG.lean` is 194 nonblank lines and eight declarations. It
     defines relation acyclicity and a list topological-order certificate for
     an arbitrary carrier. Neither object stores a finite-carrier capability;
     only `topologicalOrder_of_acyclic` assumes `Fintype` and `DecidableEq`.
  2. The well-founded minimal-vertex construction is adapted from pinned
     `Math/DAG.lean`, but its `Fin n`, length-equals-`n`, and game-adjacent
     surface are removed. The public facts are direct-parent order,
     transitive-ancestor order, construction, and the converse acyclicity
     certificate.
  3. The 85-nonblank-line diamond probe derives an order for an arbitrary
     four-constructor carrier, proves the middle vertices incomparable, and
     exercises direct and transitive predecessor ordering.
  4. Focused builds complete in 1,666 jobs. The reusable module has no
     GameTheory import or project dependency, and `GameTheory.Math` continues to
     import no game module.
  5. Both files have zero placeholder, native-decision, direct-update, or
     source transport tokens. Axiom checks use at most `propext`,
     `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`; the choice occurs only when deriving
     an order or choosing the diamond witness.
  6. The integrated full build completes in 3,329 jobs. Phase 2 reports
     `TRANSPORT_GAMETHEORYMATH_SOURCE=0`,
     `GAMETHEORYMATH_FORBIDDEN_IMPORTS=0`, and
     `GAMETHEORYMATH_GAME_REJECTED=1`; all Phase 2/3 expected boundary and
     reachability probes pass.
- **Outcome:** supports. The reusable DAG proof survives with a better
  capability boundary and no public `Fin n` transport. No kill condition
  fired.
- **Next action:** define experimental typed MAID syntax over this arbitrary
  node carrier, with site-local policies and order-free frontier evaluation;
  do not promote the syntax until the same-owner and diamond probes instantiate
  it.

### EXP-040: heterogeneous site-local frontier evaluation

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `9bdc140`
- **Status:** complete
- **Decision / question:** D2, D9, D14, and T3; whether a general typed MAID can
  keep heterogeneous node values and native site-local policies while
  evaluating every currently minimal unresolved node in one order-free
  frontier step.
- **Hypothesis, recorded before implementation:** store only node kinds,
  predecessor/observation finsets, a dependent value family, and acyclicity in
  syntax. Put finite enumeration and decidable equality on evaluation. A state
  may carry a total assignment plus a resolved finset; unresolved coordinates
  contain explicit defaults and are semantically inaccessible. A frontier draw
  is a dependent finite product, and updating all frontier coordinates at once
  needs no equality transport because each sampled coordinate retains its
  original node index.
- **Representative slice:** one typed API instantiated twice: the four-node
  diamond and the same-owner/disjoint-observation graph from EXP-038. Prove
  generic frontier nonemptiness before completion, parent closure after a
  step, exact simultaneous commitment, and a terminal outcome law sensitive to
  both site-local policies.
- **Competing designs:** homogeneous node values; dependent partial maps with a
  transport module; total defaulted assignments plus resolved finsets;
  explicit topological folds; or retaining only the concrete stable MAID.
- **Kill conditions:** user-visible transport, direct `Function.update`,
  unresolved values reaching a node law, combined-view policies, stored
  `Fintype`/`DecidableEq`, order-dependent native evaluation, or failure of
  generic frontier progress.
- **Evidence:**
  1. The promoted `Languages/MAID/Basic.lean` is 327 nonblank lines and 33
     declarations. `Structure`
     stores node kind, causal and observed parent finsets, a dependent value
     family, locality laws, and acyclicity—no order, `Fintype`, or
     `DecidableEq`. `Policy` is indexed by decision site and receives only that
     site's observed-parent configuration.
  2. A frontier state stores a total defaulted assignment, a resolved finset,
     and predecessor closure. `frontier_nonempty` derives a well-founded
     minimal unresolved node whenever the state is incomplete. `extend`
     preserves predecessor closure and
     `resolved_ssubset_extend_of_incomplete` proves strict progress.
     `run_complete_of_remaining_le` lifts that measure through finite-law
     support, and `completesWithin_card` gives the uniform one-step-per-node
     completion bound.
  3. `frontierLaw` uses `FinDist.pi` over the dependent frontier family.
     `Assignment.resolve` updates every sampled coordinate simultaneously
     without `Function.update` or equality transport. A node law is constructed
     only after its causal parents—and, by subset, its observed parents—are
     proved resolved.
  4. The 494-nonblank-line hostile test has 61 declarations. Its diamond uses
     four different dependent alphabets (`Bool`, `Fin 2`, `Unit`, `Bool`) and
     derives the correct initial frontier. Its same-owner fixture has two
     disjointly observed decision sites in one frontier.
  5. The actual generic runner, not a manual second evaluator, reaches a pure
     complete state in two steps under responsive and constant policies.
     Both chance nodes and both decision nodes commit simultaneously at their
     respective frontier. Responsive utility is two; constant-false and
     constant-true utility are one, so separate theorems show right- and
     left-site policy sensitivity.
  6. The evaluator has exactly two project prerequisites, `FinDist` and the
     game-independent DAG module. The focused target builds in 1,715 jobs and
     the full build in 3,331. Source scans find zero placeholders,
     `native_decide`, direct updates, or transport tokens.
  7. Axiom checks for generic frontier progress/strict growth, heterogeneous
     frontier calculation, the two-step run, simultaneous commitment, and both
     policy-sensitivity theorems use only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and
     `Quot.sound`. Phase 2/3 audits retain all expected trust, boundary, and
     reachability measurements.
- **Outcome:** supports. The total-defaulted assignment design preserves
  heterogeneous indices without a transport surface, and native site-local
  policies survive the exact same-owner falsifier that rejected combined
  Protocol views. No kill condition fired.
- **Next action:** translate an explicit topological order to an EFG whose
  information states expose exactly `observedParents`. Keep the implementation
  experimental until the serialized run equals this frontier law and order
  independence is proved.

### EXP-041: typed MAID serialization through EFG

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `c49f826`
- **Status:** supports; compiler locality, general serialized order
  independence, and exact native/serialized/actual-runner assignment-law
  equality pass
- **Decision / question:** D6, D14, and T3; whether an explicit topological
  order can compile the typed native diagram to the accepted
  `Languages.EFG.Game` while preserving decision-site locality and the native
  terminal law.
- **Prediction:** use a dependent sum of the source owner's decision sites and
  their value types as the EFG action carrier. At a serialized decision state,
  the information state identifies that site and contains exactly its
  `observedParents` configuration; an earlier incomparable decision may exist
  in the execution state but cannot occur in this view. Keep source owners as
  players. Store the complete resolved prefix in the execution state so the
  EFG tree law has a unique predecessor, but do not make that prefix a policy
  input.
- **Representative slice:** compile EXP-040's same-owner,
  disjoint-observation diagram at both topological orders. Prove that the
  second decision's information state is unchanged when the earlier
  incomparable decision changes, map every native site-local behavioral
  policy into the target information model, and compare both serialized
  terminal laws with the native frontier law.
- **Competing designs:** dependent tagged source actions; one synthetic player
  per decision site; a homogeneous sum with value transport; or retaining the
  native frontier evaluator without an EFG bridge.
- **Measurements to collect:** stable/public API delta, authored and import
  size, focused/full build jobs, source trust and transport tokens, axiom
  profile, the exact information-state types, outcome equality in both orders,
  and Phase 2/3 boundary probes.
- **Kill conditions:** a synthetic player or padding action; a policy view
  containing an unobserved or merely earlier node; direct `Function.update`;
  user-visible equality transport; stored finite capabilities; failure of
  `treeShaped` or `singleMover`; unequal native/serialized terminal laws; or
  order-dependent serialized outcomes.
- **Evidence so far:**
  1. The eventual promoted modules `Languages/MAID/ToEFG.lean` and
     `Languages/MAID/Order.lean` are 1,344 nonblank lines/69 declarations and
     866 nonblank lines/24 declarations respectively; the 536-nonblank-line
     hostile test remains experimental with 50 declarations. During the
     experiment the stable API delta was zero.
  2. `Action` is the dependent sum of one real source owner's decision sites
     and their value types. `Stage` stores a dependent-valued path certified
     to equal a prefix of the supplied topological order. Neither syntax nor
     state invents a player, padding value, homogeneous alphabet, or stored
     finite typeclass.
  3. `View.acting` contains exactly one source decision site and a
     `Config` over that site's `observedParents`. `behavioralProfile` maps the
     native site-local law directly to the corresponding menu choice; the
     serialized state is not an argument.
  4. The generic compiler constructs the accepted `EFG.Game`, including
     `menu_adequate`, `treeShaped`, and `singleMover`. Tree shape is proved from
     the resolved prefix: every realized target has one source prefix, and a
     decision target records enough dependent action data to recover the
     unique joint action.
  5. The hostile test supplies two explicit topological orders. In the
     left-first order, changing the earlier left decision leaves the later
     right-site view equal; `left_view_hides_right_decision` proves the
     symmetric fact under the right-first order. Both compiled games and both
     native behavioral profiles elaborate.
  6. The compiler has two project prerequisites, typed MAID semantics and the
     stable EFG specialization. The focused test builds in 1,724 jobs and the
     full build in 3,334. Source scans report zero placeholders,
     `native_decide`, direct updates, transport tokens, or `open Classical`.
     Phase 2/3 expected measurements and all reachability probes pass.
  7. Axiom checks for the generic tree-shaped EFG, behavioral profile, and
     both locality theorems use only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and
     `Quot.sound`.
  8. `serialNodeLaw` and `serialJointLaw` name the source-facing one-node
     midpoint. `serialJointLaw_bind_transition` proves generically that drawing
     this legal joint law and taking the actual compiled EFG transition is
     exactly `serialStep`; it is not a second transition definition.
  9. The hostile responsive policy runs to completion under both opposite
     serial orders. `serial_assignment_law_order_independent` proves the two
     complete assignment laws equal, while
     `left_serial_assignment_law_eq_native` and its right-order counterpart
     prove each equals the native two-frontier runner's assignment law.
  10. `behavioralJoint_eq_serialJointLaw_unit` identifies the actual
      `InformationModel.behavioralJoint` with the source joint law for any
      one-owner typed diagram. `behavioralJoint_bind_transition_unit` composes
      that law with the real EFG transition, and
      `map_state_runBehavioralFrom_eq_serialRun_unit` lifts the equality through
      the Protocol history runner for every fuel and starting history. The two
      hostile compiled games therefore have equal actual behavioral assignment
      laws, and each equals the native frontier runner.
  11. `assignmentStep_comm` ports the pinned adjacent-kernel idea to arbitrary
      typed node values, while `assignmentRun_swap_adjacent` lifts it under any
      prefix and suffix. `assignmentRun_eq_of_perm` then bubbles matching heads
      through dependency-compatible permutations, so
      `assignmentRun_topological_order_independent` proves the direct general
      theorem without exposing an order-swap reachability certificate.
      `map_assignment_serialRun` connects this algebra to the compiler, yielding
      `serialRun_topological_order_independent` for arbitrary player and node
      carriers.
  12. Two information-model product lemmas collapse inactive coordinates and
      isolate an at-most-one active coordinate. The compiler's single-mover law
      then yields `behavioralJoint_eq_serialJointLaw` for every finite source
      player type, not only `Unit`. `behavioralJoint_bind_transition` and
      `map_state_runBehavioralFrom_eq_serialRun` lift this through the actual
      transition and Protocol history runner.
      `behavioralRun_topological_order_independent` is therefore the general
      actual compiled-EFG assignment-law theorem.
  13. The promoted `Languages/MAID/FrontierEquivalence.lean` is 726 nonblank
      lines and 23 declarations. `finDist_pi_reindex` and
      `fixedAssignmentRun_eq_pi` prove
      that a dependent simultaneous frontier product equals duplicate-free
      sequential draws of the same fixed node laws.
      `map_values_step_eq_assignmentRun` then identifies one native frontier
      step with one serialized pass over that frontier.
  14. The current frontier followed by the still-unresolved topological order
      is proved to be a duplicate-free, dependency-compatible permutation of
      the current unresolved order. The cardinality-bounded induction in
      `map_values_run_eq_assignmentRun_unresolved` lifts the one-step equality
      through every native layer without assuming that frontiers are
      singletons.
  15. `nativeRun_eq_compiledBehavioralRun` is the general end-to-end theorem:
      for arbitrary finite source-player and node carriers, the native
      simultaneous-frontier run mapped to assignments equals the actual
      compiled `InformationModel.runBehavioral` assignment law at any supplied
      topological order. The new module builds in 1,723 jobs; the full project
      builds in 3,335. Source scans report zero placeholders,
      `native_decide`, direct updates, transport tokens, or `open Classical`;
      Phase 2/3 expected measurements pass. Axiom checks use only `propext`,
      `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
  16. Post-gate delivery adds the 397-nonblank-line, 19-declaration
      `Languages/MAID/Strategic.lean`. `ownerPolicyEquiv` proves that one
      source owner's complete family of site-local rules is equivalent to that
      owner's compiled behavioral policy; the inactive choice is uniquely
      forced, and every acting choice decodes to its typed source value.
      `behavioralProfileEquiv_update` proves a unilateral update stays at the
      same source-owner coordinate. `isNash_native_iff_compiled` then proves
      the exact native/compiled behavioral Nash equivalence using the canonical
      `IsNash`, without a MAID-specific equilibrium predicate. The strategic
      module builds in 1,732 jobs and the full project in 3,337; source audits
      remain zero for placeholders, custom axioms, direct updates, transport
      tokens, and forbidden imports. Its flagship declarations use only
      `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- **Outcome:** supports the prediction and closes EXP-041. General typed MAID
  serialization is local, order-independent, and exactly equal to both the
  native frontier evaluator and the actual compiled-EFG behavioral runner.
  This closed T3's outcome-law half and removed D14's block on public general
  MAID recovery. The subsequent promoted strategic module closes the remaining
  source-owner equilibrium transfer.
- **Next action:** T3 is complete. Inventory and close the remaining T4
  language transfer; general MAID refinements and Kuhn-facing recovery may now
  proceed behind their ordinary dependency gates.

### EXP-042: one-shot NFG through FOSG and Protocol

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `2b659df`
- **Status:** supports; exact outcome and utility laws pass through the actual
  Protocol history runner
- **Decision / question:** D0/T4, D4, D6, and the NFG/FOSG language gates;
  whether a deterministic normal-form game can compile to a genuine
  factored-observation stochastic game, then through the accepted Protocol
  runner, with an exact commuting outcome law and without a second static,
  history, utility, or solution theory.
- **Prediction:** represent the source NFG as transparent finite-language
  syntax compiling to a deterministic `GameForm`. Compile its single
  simultaneous move to a general-state `ExecutionProtocol`; give every player
  an information-local initial menu containing exactly its source actions and
  observations that reveal no opponent's current action. The terminal state
  retains the realized source profile or outcome. Lifting a source profile to
  target policies should make the actual horizon-one history law, mapped to the
  source outcome, definitionally or propositionally equal to the source
  `GameForm.play`.
- **Representative slice:** a two-player action-sensitive game in which both
  players are active at the initial history. Prove simultaneous activation,
  information locality, one-step stopping, the exact generic commuting law,
  and the concrete hostile outcome equation.
- **Competing designs:** a native FOSG syntax compiling to
  `ExecutionProtocol` plus `InformationModel`; a thin wrapper around those two
  canonical objects; sequentialization through the single-mover EFG/tree
  frontend; or retiring T4 and keeping NFG solely static.
- **Measurements to collect:** declaration and nonblank-line delta; imports
  and closure jobs; exact source/target strategy and outcome types; direct
  update and transport tokens; placeholders and axiom profile; simultaneous
  activation and observation visibility; named source and target law equality;
  and Phase 3 positive and negative reachability probes.
- **Kill conditions:** a synthetic player, sequentialized current actions,
  padding/default actions, a target policy that reads hidden execution state or
  an opponent's current action, duplicated transition/history/equilibrium
  semantics, utility stored in execution syntax, a generic morphism or
  certificate hierarchy needed only to package the direct equality, stored
  finite capabilities, direct `Function.update`, user-visible equality
  transport, or failure of the actual compiled target law to equal the source
  play law.
- **Evidence so far:**
  1. The pinned bridge's direct utility-law proof is 21 nonblank lines and its
     morphism wrapper is 9, but its closure is 31 files/11,031 nonblank lines.
     The declaration ledger isolates the one-step law from that predecessor
     infrastructure.
  2. D6 already rules out the superficially smaller tree target:
     `sequentialization_enlarges_strategy_space` exhibits a contingent plan
     unavailable in simultaneous play. T4 must therefore exercise the
     general-state Protocol branch.
  3. The experimental compiler and hostile test are 401 nonblank lines and 42
     declarations. They import `Protocol.Strategic` and add no stable
     declaration or import during the experiment.
  4. `NFG.Game.toGameForm` is the deterministic canonical form.
     `FOSG.Game` contains only an `ExecutionProtocol` and its
     `InformationModel`; `FOSG.Game.toGameForm` is the existing Protocol
     compiler, not a second evaluator.
  5. The one-shot state is either initial or terminal with the full source
     profile. Every real source player is active initially and the certified
     simultaneous joint action is decoded without a default or padding action.
     `Nonempty` actions are requested only by the execution construction's
     progress proof.
  6. Each policy input is only `acting` or `done`. In the hostile two-player
     game, changing the column player's current action leaves the row player's
     initial policy action unchanged, while the terminal law changes from the
     all-false outcome to `(false, true)`.
  7. `toProtocolForm_play_policyProfile` proves the actual horizon-one
     information-local history law, mapped to the source outcome, equals the
     direct NFG play law. `toProtocolForm_utilityLaw_policyProfile` derives the
     predecessor's joint utility-distribution equality for every external
     utility.
  8. The focused test builds in 1,722 jobs and the full project in 3,339.
     Phase 2 and Phase 3 expected source audits pass. Source scans find zero
     placeholders, native decisions, direct updates, transports, custom
     axioms, or `open Classical`.
  9. Axiom checks for both generic laws and all hostile simultaneous/locality
     probes use only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
  10. Promotion splits `Languages.NFG`, `Languages.FOSG`, and
      `Languages.Bridges.NFGFOSG`; the hostile fixture stays experimental. The
      focused stable/test build is 1,724 jobs and the full build 3,341.
      Full Phase 2/3 reachability audits pass. New probes report NFG
      boundary/input counts `2/3`, FOSG solution/input counts `2/3`, and all
      four intended bridge inputs reached.
- **Outcome:** supports. No kill condition fired. D15 adopts a utility-free
  deterministic NFG frontend, the transparent Protocol-backed FOSG
  specialization, and the named direct one-shot bridge. The predecessor's
  generic morphism wrapper is retired under D7.
- **Next action:** T4 and every frozen transfer are complete. Continue broad
  NFG/FOSG declaration recovery behind the passed gates; do not generalize the
  retired morphism wrapper without a new composition consumer.

### EXP-043: epistemic ownership versus Protocol information

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `d68e707`
- **Status:** complete
- **Decision / question:** the overdue Phase 0 D-KNOW probe; whether Aumann
  agreement and partition-based common knowledge belong directly on
  `Protocol.InformationModel.InfoState`, in a separate epistemic branch, or in
  game-free mathematics.
- **Prediction:** an arbitrary Protocol information state is history-local,
  not a partition of execution states. A merging protocol can reach one state
  through two histories that leave distinct information states, so no
  state-indexed view can recover `infoOf` and `InformationModel.InfoSet`s may
  overlap. Aumann's theorem should instead use an explicit finite-cell
  epistemic partition and the canonical `FinDist` prior in a separate stable
  branch. Game-free view-induced S5 lemmas may later be extracted to
  `GameTheory.Math` if the epistemic consumer needs them.
- **Representative slice:** construct a one-player merging protocol whose two
  simultaneous actions reach the same terminal execution state while the
  player remembers which action it took. Prove that terminal state lies in two
  distinct `InfoSet`s and refute every state-only view representing `infoOf`.
  Independently adapt the pinned finite-cell posterior and full Aumann
  agreement theorem to a `FinDist` prior with operation-local full support.
- **Competing designs:** define epistemic events directly from Protocol
  `InfoSet`; add a tree-shaped/unique-history premise and derive partitions
  only there; adopt a parallel epistemic partition object; or place the entire
  development in `GameTheory.Math`.
- **Measurements:** the 287-nonblank-line, 22-declaration spike imports only
  `GameTheory.Protocol.Information`; its positive theorem uses the existing
  `GameTheory.Math.Probability.FinDist`, with `DecidableEq` and full support requested only by
  the operations and theorem that need them. The focused build completes in
  1,718 jobs and the full build in 3,342. Source scans find zero placeholders,
  native decisions, custom axioms, direct updates, transports, `HEq`, tactic
  `change`, or `open Classical`. All three flagship declarations report only
  `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`. Positive probes reach
  `FinDist`, `InformationModel`, the experimental partition, and Aumann
  agreement; negative probes reject `IsNash`, the sequential-analysis
  convergence declaration, `stdSimplex`, and `Polynomial`. Phase 2/3
  non-reachability audits and the declaration-coverage audit pass.
- **Kill conditions:** silently choose one history for a merging state; add
  partition laws to every `InformationModel`; duplicate the finite-law
  representation; make an action profile or game form a premise of Aumann's
  theorem; store `Fintype` or decidability in epistemic data; or require
  topology/Analysis for the finite agreement theorem.
- **Evidence:** Mathlib has no Aumann/common-knowledge development. The
  representative theorem uses only finite cells, a common prior, self-evidence, and
  finite sums. Protocol deliberately defines `InfoSet` by existence of a
  history and does not assert a state partition. The hostile model satisfies
  menu adequacy, yet its one merged terminal state belongs to the information
  sets for both `done false` and `done true`; moreover no function of execution
  state can represent `infoOf` on both histories. Recovering a partition from
  Protocol therefore needs an explicit extra premise such as unique history;
  it is not a law of `InformationModel`.
- **Outcome:** supports the predicted separate epistemic branch. D16 adopts a
  finite-cell `Epistemic.InfoPartition` using the canonical `FinDist` prior and
  rejects both adding partition laws to Protocol and duplicating Protocol
  histories inside the epistemic API. The theorem is game-theoretic domain
  semantics, so moving it wholesale to `GameTheory.Math` is not earned.
- **Promotion:** `GameTheory.Epistemic.Basic` and
  `GameTheory.Epistemic.Agreement` now contain the positive slice without a
  Protocol import; the public root re-exports their umbrella. Full Phase 2/3
  reachability audits pass with epistemic input/boundary counts `3/5` and two
  rejected reciprocal Protocol probes. The stable theorem's axiom profile is
  unchanged.
- **Next action:** inventory the remaining D-KNOW declarations before broad S5
  and approximate-common-knowledge recovery. The merging counterexample
  remains experiment evidence, not stable API.
- **Recovery follow-on:** the finite S5 and public-event common-knowledge
  layer is now stable. All 30 declarations from pinned
  `CommonKnowledge.lean` have reviewed rows; 32 approximate-common-knowledge
  declarations remain. The expanded root builds in 1,716 focused / 3,350 full
  jobs, with Epistemic input/boundary probe counts `4/5`.
- **Approximate follow-on:** the `p`-belief, mutual/common `p`-belief,
  threshold-monotonicity, and exact-to-approximate bridge layer is now stable.
  D-KNOW accounting is 48/62; the quantitative approximate-agreement theorem
  and 13 private mass lemmas remain. The expanded root builds in 1,717 focused
  / 3,351 full jobs with input/boundary probe counts `5/5`.
- **Quantitative close-out:** the Monderer--Samet report-distance theorem and
  its 13 private mass/cell lemmas are stable. D-KNOW is complete at 62/62
  declarations. The final root is 1,149 nonblank lines, builds in 1,718
  focused / 3,352 full jobs, and passes input/boundary probes `6/5` with zero
  source transport and the standard axiom profile.

### EXP-044: evolutionary stability static/dynamic ownership

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `fe9cce9`
- **Status:** complete
- **Decision / question:** the remaining Phase 0 D-EVOL probe; whether ESS/NSS
  belongs in the static Core, a separate stable evolutionary branch, or an
  analytic population-dynamics branch.
- **Prediction:** the pinned nine-declaration family is entirely static. ESS
  and NSS need only a two-argument real payoff kernel; the flagship
  ESS-to-symmetric-Nash theorem should cross into Core through one canonical
  deterministic `GameForm` and `IsNash`. Replicator dynamics, simplex
  invariance, topology, and limiting behavior should remain absent until a
  dynamics theorem earns an opt-in `Analysis.Evolutionary` root.
- **Representative slice:** recover ESS, NSS, their elementary implications,
  the symmetric two-player form/utility presentation, and the generic
  ESS-to-Nash theorem. Use a Boolean payoff kernel where a mutant ties the
  resident against the resident, so the second ESS clause is genuinely used
  rather than discharged by strict Nash.
- **Competing designs:** put ESS directly in `Core.Response`; adopt a separate
  stable `Evolutionary` root with a one-way Nash bridge; or make ESS part of a
  simplex/population-dynamics structure under Analysis.
- **Measurements:** the combined hostile slice has 134 nonblank lines and 17
  declarations and imports only `GameTheory.Core.Utility`. ESS and NSS take
  only `S → S → ℝ` and a resident strategy; they store no scalar structure,
  carrier enumeration, population law, or topology. The bridge uses the
  canonical `GameForm`, `euPreference`, `Profile.update` through
  `isNash_iff`, and the single public `IsNash` predicate. The focused build
  completes in 1,720 jobs and the full build in 3,346. Source audits find zero
  placeholders, native decisions, custom axioms, direct `Function.update`,
  transports, `HEq`, tactic `change`, `Fintype.ofFinite`, or `open Classical`.
  The generic bridge, hostile ESS proof, and hostile Nash theorem use only
  `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`. Positive probes reach
  `GameForm`, `IsNash`, experimental `IsESS`, and the bridge; negative probes
  reject Protocol execution, Analysis Nash existence, `stdSimplex`, and
  `Polynomial`. The Phase 2 expected source audit passes.
- **Kill conditions:** define a second Nash predicate; store a population law,
  `Fintype`, topology, or dynamics in the ESS object; duplicate profile update;
  require Analysis for the static theorem; orient either player's payoff or
  unilateral deviation incorrectly; or weaken the nonvacuous stability
  example into a strict-Nash-only witness.
- **Evidence:** all nine pinned declarations use a payoff kernel
  `S → S → ℝ`; only the final bridge mentions the old universal game object.
  No pinned declaration defines a population state, replicator equation,
  trajectory, limit, or simplex invariant. The hostile payoff makes
  `u(true,true) = u(false,true)`, so strict Nash cannot establish ESS; the
  checked second clause `u(true,false) > u(false,false)` is necessary. Both
  player orientations then satisfy canonical Nash through the generic theorem.
- **Outcome:** supports the predicted separate stable static branch. D17
  adopts `GameTheory.Evolutionary` for ESS/NSS and a one-way bridge into Core.
  ESS is not added to the Core concept surface, and no dynamics or Analysis
  carrier is bundled with it.
- **Promotion:** `GameTheory.Evolutionary.Basic` now owns the game-free static
  definitions and facts; `GameTheory.Evolutionary.Nash` owns the one-way Core
  bridge; the public root re-exports their umbrella. Full Phase 2/3
  reachability audits pass with Basic input/boundary counts `2/6`, bridge
  input/boundary counts `3/4`, and two rejected reverse probes from each of
  Core and Protocol. The stable root is 119 nonblank lines and the focused
  build completes in 1,722 jobs.
- **Promotion validation:** the full build completes in 3,349 jobs, and the
  complete nine-row D-EVOL ledger passes the declaration-coverage audit.
- **Next action:** keep the hostile payoff as experiment evidence and admit no
  population dynamics until a named analytic theorem reserves a new
  experiment. Continue with the D-KNOW inventory and minimal D8 obligations.

### EXP-045: minimal consumer-backed transformation closure

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `c306f24`
- **Status:** supports; concrete equivalences suffice and no transformation
  structure is earned
- **Decision / question:** D8 and W1-H; which transformation declarations are
  genuinely public infrastructure after the direct language transfers have
  removed the predecessor's generic morphism and certificate wrappers.
- **Prediction:** player reindexing and per-player strategy equivalence need
  only transparent functions and exact laws. A single game-free
  `FinDist.pi_reindex` theorem should serve both mixed extension and the
  existing MAID serialization consumer. Nash and CE invariance should follow
  directly from invertibility, without `FormHom`, `FormEquiv`, a generic
  equilibrium certificate, or user-visible equality transport.
- **Representative slice:** reindex a finite game along a nontrivial player
  equivalence; relabel a player's strategies along a nontrivial equivalence;
  prove that reindexing commutes with independent mixing; and transport both a
  Nash profile and a correlated law. Replace the MAID-local finite-product
  lemma with the shared probability theorem as the second real consumer.
- **Competing designs:** revive `FormHom`/`FormEquiv` plus deviation-reflection
  structures; expose only concrete equivalence operations and preservation
  theorems; or leave every transfer bespoke in its language module.
- **Measurements to collect:** declaration and nonblank-line delta; focused
  and full build jobs; import closure; number of consumers; source transport,
  direct update, placeholder, and axiom audits; and whether CE transport needs
  a law beyond invertibility.
- **Kill conditions:** a public transformation structure with only one
  theorem consumer; a second equilibrium predicate; direct `Function.update`;
  user-visible `cast`, `Eq.ndrec`, `HEq`, tactic `change`, or substitution
  transport; stored finiteness or decidability; Core importing a language; or
  a claimed equilibrium transport that silently assumes target deviations can
  be reflected.
- **Evidence:** the 395-nonblank-line, 37-declaration experiment imports only
  `GameTheory.Core.Mixed`. The player fixture swaps unequal `Bool` and `Fin 3`
  strategy carriers. The strategy fixture flips both Boolean carriers and
  transports a recommendation-dependent correlated law by conjugating every
  response map. Player reindexing commutes with the actual mixed play law via
  forward/inverse dependent `FinDist.pi` reindexing. The forward orientation
  has the exact shape needed by the existing MAID serialization consumer.
- **Measurements:** the focused build completes in 1,721 jobs. Source scans
  find zero placeholders, native decisions, direct updates, transports,
  `HEq`, tactic `change`, `Fintype.ofFinite`, or `open Classical`. Nash, CE,
  mixed lifting, and both hostile witnesses use only `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- **Outcome:** supports prediction and decides D8. No `FormHom`, `FormEquiv`,
  payoff-law morphism, or equilibrium certificate is earned. D8 adopts
  transparent player/strategy equivalence operations, the two game-free
  finite-product orientations, and direct Nash/CE invariance theorems.
- **Next action:** promote the accepted declarations, replace MAID's local
  probability proof with the shared theorem, add reachability/source audits,
  and close W1-H only after focused and full builds pass.
- **Promotion:** `GameTheory.Math.Probability.FinDist` now owns exact forward and inverse
  dependent-product reindexing laws; `Core.Transform` owns the transparent
  player/strategy operations and Nash/CE/mixed preservation theorems; MAID
  uses the shared forward law. The stable module and regression test contain
  246 and 67 nonblank lines. The focused regression target builds in 1,722
  jobs. Phase 2 source audits pass with no new transport, direct update,
  placeholder, custom axiom, carrier-reducibility, or import-boundary defect.
  Core reaches all six D8 probes; the game-free probability root reaches both
  laws and rejects both game-semantic probes. Phase 3 records the single
  intended MAID use. The full project builds in 3,355 jobs, and every promoted
  flagship retains the standard axiom profile. W1-H is complete.

### EXP-046: ownership of observable pre-play cheap talk

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `ec81e80`
- **Status:** supports static ownership; decides D18
- **Decision / question:** D0/D5/D6 and D-COMM; whether the observable
  cheap-talk extension needed by the NFG babbling examples is a static
  strategy enrichment of `GameForm`, or whether its message-before-action
  timing forces ownership by Protocol.
- **Prediction:** for the pure babbling theorem, the enriched strategy can be
  a message plus a contingent base strategy over the public message profile.
  Its play law is the base form evaluated at the realized contingent actions.
  The ordinary `IsNash` predicate should then prove babbling by projecting an
  arbitrary enriched unilateral deviation to the base action it induces
  against default messages. Protocol is earned only by a theorem that observes
  intermediate message histories or randomizes during the communication
  stage.
- **Representative slice:** a two-message Battle-of-the-Sexes extension in
  which the deviator may change both its message and its entire contingent
  action plan. Embed the opera and football equilibria as babbling profiles
  and prove both with ordinary `IsNash`.
- **Competing designs:** a static `GameForm` construction with a generic
  babbling theorem; a two-stage `ExecutionProtocol` with a compilation theorem;
  or an inert-extension abstraction that forgets the communication-specific
  strategy shape.
- **Measurements to collect:** source/import surface; focused and full build
  jobs; whether the proof uses only `Profile.update`; whether any second
  equilibrium predicate, stored finiteness, transport, or Protocol dependency
  appears; axiom profile; and whether the hostile contingent-plan deviation is
  discharged generically.
- **Kill conditions:** a static construction cannot represent the arbitrary
  contingent-plan deviation; the babbling proof needs intermediate histories;
  the extension introduces another Nash predicate or evaluator; direct
  `Function.update`, user-visible dependent transport, stored finite
  capabilities, or a reverse Core-to-Protocol import is required.
- **Evidence:** the 141-nonblank-line experiment has 20 declarations and one
  authored import, `GameTheory.Examples.Classic`. Its generic construction
  depends only on the static form/equilibrium closure brought by that example;
  it imports no Protocol or Analysis module. The focused target builds in
  1,738 jobs.
- **Observation:** the arbitrary enriched deviation changes both its message
  and its complete contingent plan. `actionProfile_update_embedProfile`
  nevertheless proves that the induced base profile is exactly one canonical
  `Profile.update`; the preference-parametric babbling theorem then closes by
  the ordinary `isNash_iff` characterization. Both Battle-of-the-Sexes
  equilibria instantiate it without further payoff reasoning.
- **Measurements:** source scans find zero placeholders, native decisions,
  direct `Function.update`, transports, `HEq`, stored finite capabilities,
  `open Classical`, or custom axioms. The generic theorem and both witnesses
  use only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- **Outcome:** supports the prediction and decides D18. Observable one-stage
  pre-play cheap talk is a static `GameForm` strategy enrichment. Protocol
  remains the owner only when a theorem observes message histories, staged
  rounds, or during-play randomization. The inert-extension competitor is too
  weak as the public construction because it erases the message/plan shape.
- **Promotion:** `GameTheory/Core/CheapTalk.lean` contains the 17-declaration
  generic construction; `GameTheory/Examples/CheapTalk.lean` contains the
  concrete extension and two witnesses. The focused build passes in 1,739
  jobs and the full project in 3,361 jobs. Phase 2 verifies the original
  transport budget, zero forbidden Core imports, positive reachability of
  both public cheap-talk symbols, and rejection of all four Protocol/Analysis
  boundary probes. The generic theorem and both examples retain the standard
  `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound` axiom profile.
- **Next action:** inventory the whole D-COMM family, then test public
  randomness and Electronic Mail against the static/Protocol timing boundary.

### EXP-047: static cheap talk as public randomization

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `866f113`
- **Status:** supports the static bridge; decides D19
- **Decision / question:** D8/D18 and D-COMM/S-MIX/S-CORR; whether a mixed
  profile of the static cheap-talk extension can be pushed through its realized
  action profile to a base correlated equilibrium, or whether public
  randomization forces a staged Protocol model.
- **Prediction:** independent mixed play of message-plus-plan strategies
  already supplies the needed public random source. Any recommendation-reading
  base deviation should lift to a cheap-talk deviation that retains the
  message and applies the deviation to the contingent action. Exact commutation
  of the induced laws should let the ordinary `IsNash` and `IsCorrelatedEq`
  predicates prove the result.
- **Representative slice:** define the induced base action-profile law, lift an
  arbitrary recommendation-dependent base deviation, prove the profile-law
  commutation, and derive a base correlated equilibrium from a mixed Nash
  profile of the cheap-talk form. The theorem is preference-parametric if the
  exact-law proof really carries the argument.
- **Competing designs:** keep public randomization as a static bridge over
  `GameForm.CheapTalkExtension` and `GameForm.mixed`; compile a staged public
  signal protocol; or add a communication-specific mixed equilibrium
  predicate.
- **Measurements to collect:** new probability lemmas required; authored
  imports and lines; exact use of `Profile.update`; source hazards; axiom
  profile; focused build cost; and reachability of Protocol/Analysis symbols.
- **Kill conditions:** the induced action law cannot commute with an arbitrary
  recommendation-dependent deviation; the proof needs an intermediate
  communication history; a second Nash/CE predicate or evaluator appears; or
  direct `Function.update`, dependent transport, stored finiteness, or a
  Core-to-Protocol/Analysis dependency is required.
- **Evidence:** the 152-nonblank-line experiment has eight declarations and one
  authored import, `GameTheory.Core.CheapTalk`. The focused target builds in
  1,720 jobs. One general finite-law lemma proves that mapping one coordinate
  of an independent profile law equals mapping that marginal before taking the
  product.
- **Observation:** a recommendation-reading base deviation lifts by retaining
  the cheap-talk message and applying the response to every contingent action.
  The realized profile and induced finite law commute exactly with this lift.
  The mixed-Nash inequality therefore becomes the correlated-equilibrium
  inequality by rewriting both complete outcome laws; expected utility,
  convexity, and public-message conditioning never enter the proof.
- **Measurements:** the final theorem is preference-parametric and uses the
  ordinary `IsNash` of `C.form.mixed` and ordinary `IsCorrelatedEq` of the base
  form. Source scans find zero placeholders, native decisions, direct
  `Function.update`, transports, `HEq`, stored finite capabilities,
  `open Classical`, or custom axioms. The probability lemma and headline
  theorem use only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- **Outcome:** supports the prediction and decides D19. Public randomization
  generated by independent mixed play is a static Core bridge over D18, not a
  Protocol execution. No communication-specific equilibrium predicate is
  admitted. Conditional public-signal disintegration remains a separate
  theorem family and is not silently claimed by this experiment.
- **Promotion:** `GameTheory/Core/CheapTalkRandomization.lean` contains the
  exact-law bridge and the preference-parametric CE and CCE results. The
  focused target builds in 1,720 jobs and the full project in 3,363 jobs.
  Phase 2 verifies every source/import budget, positive reachability of both
  D19 public symbols, and rejection of all four Protocol/Analysis boundary
  probes. The promoted theorems retain the measured standard axiom profile.
- **Next action:** decide whether a live payoff-mixture consumer earns
  message-conditioned public-signal disintegration; otherwise proceed to the
  Electronic Mail ownership slice.

### EXP-048: ownership of the finite Electronic Mail example

- **Date / revision:** 2026-07-30, working tree based on `138c6d1`
- **Status:** supports the static Examples bridge; decides D20
- **Decision / question:** D16/D18 and D-COMM; whether the finite Electronic
  Mail results are a static bridge between the canonical Bayesian and
  Epistemic branches, or whether their messaging interpretation forces a
  Protocol execution model.
- **Prediction:** the representative theorems observe only endpoint worlds, private
  views, posteriors, common `p`-belief, and a type-contingent action plan. One
  canonical finite prior on worlds should push forward to the Bayesian type
  prior while directly feeding the epistemic partition. No theorem quantifies
  over an execution history, so an Examples bridge should suffice.
- **Representative slice:** recover the three endpoint worlds, views, actions,
  shared finite prior, Bayesian game, candidate and deviating plans, mutual
  `p`-belief and failure of common `p`-belief at the confirmed endpoint, and
  the machine-checked failure of Bayes-Nash.
- **Competing designs:** a static Examples bridge over `BayesianGame` and
  `Epistemic`; a multistage `ExecutionProtocol` modeling each email attempt; or
  parallel communication-local probability and equilibrium APIs.
- **Measurements to collect:** whether one prior serves both branches; import
  and reachability surface; source hazards; axiom profile; focused build cost;
  and whether the non-equilibrium theorem uses ordinary `IsNash`.
- **Kill conditions:** a theorem needs an intermediate message history or
  transition probability, the endpoint abstraction cannot state the
  information result, a second prior/equilibrium concept is required, or the
  example creates a reverse stable dependency or forbidden source construct.
- **Evidence:** the 212-nonblank-line experiment has 24 declarations and four
  authored imports: the canonical Bayesian-equilibrium and approximate
  epistemic roots plus `linarith` and `norm_num`. The focused target builds in
  1,725 jobs.
- **Observation:** one uniform `FinDist EmailWorld` pushes forward to the
  Bayesian type prior and directly supplies every epistemic posterior. The
  confirmed endpoint is mutually `p`-believed up to threshold one but is not
  common `p`-belief above one half. The attack-on-message plan has value
  `-1/3` for player `true`, the canonical `Profile.update` to never attack has
  value zero, and ordinary `IsNash` therefore refutes the plan.
- **Measurements:** no Protocol or Analysis import is present; no transition
  state, second prior, Bayesian-equilibrium wrapper, or communication-local
  evaluator appears. Source scans find zero placeholders, native decisions,
  direct `Function.update`, transports, `HEq`, `Fintype.ofFinite`,
  `open Classical`, or custom axioms. All three headline theorems use only
  `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- **Outcome:** supports the prediction and decides D20. The pinned finite
  endpoint theory belongs in Examples as a bridge between the independent
  Bayesian and Epistemic roots. Protocol is reserved for a model that exposes
  email delivery transitions, stopping, or strategies during the exchange.
- **Promotion:** `GameTheory/Examples/ElectronicMail.lean` contains the stable
  endpoint bridge. The focused target builds in 1,725 jobs and the full project
  in 3,365 jobs. Phase 2 reaches all four intended inputs, rejects all four
  Protocol/Analysis boundary probes, and proves both directions of
  Bayesian/Epistemic root independence. The stable headline theorems retain
  the measured standard axiom profile.
- **Next action:** leave Protocol unspent until a dynamic email-process theorem
  is selected; D-COMM's only remaining rows are the explicitly gated
  public-signal and zero-sum value families.

### EXP-049: finite multiplicative weights over the canonical law

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-02, working tree based on `d9ff55e`
- **Status:** supports the quantitative recovery with a narrowed boundary;
  decides and promotes D21
- **Decision / question:** D0/D2/D12 and D-LEARN; whether the missing pinned
  `Math.OnlineLearning` dependency should be recovered as reusable
  `GameTheory.Math` over exact finite laws, or whether multiplicative-weights
  self-play remains deferred.
- **Prediction:** the finite action algorithm, exponential-potential argument,
  and explicit external-regret bound are game-independent. They should use
  `FinDist`, live below game semantics, and feed `Core.Learning` through a thin
  theorem without creating another regret or equilibrium API.
- **Representative slice:** recover exponential weights on one arbitrary
  finite action carrier, prove the fixed-learning-rate regret bound, then use
  the existing finite self-play bridge to obtain the pinned explicit
  approximate-CCE capstone.
- **Competing designs:** port the proof spine to `GameTheory.Math`; find an
  equivalent Mathlib theorem and adapt it; or leave the quantitative MW rows
  deferred while retaining only the finite self-play identities.
- **Measurements to collect:** Mathlib overlap; imports and closure cost;
  authored lines; PMF-to-`FinDist` friction; axiom and source-hazard profile;
  focused build cost; and whether stable Core gains an Analysis dependency.
- **Kill conditions:** the game-independent statement essentially needs an
  infinite/countable law, forces topology or `Real.exp` imports into Core,
  needs a second regret/CCE definition, depends on untrusted evaluation, or
  requires stored finiteness or forbidden transport.
- **Evidence so far:** the first Terra recovery pass found that the finite
  self-play identities adapt to current Core, while every quantitative MW
  capstone depends on pinned `mwDist`, `expWeights`, and
  `mw_externalRegret_le`; no equivalent current repository declaration exists.
- **Observation:** Mathlib supplies the exponential convexity and logarithm
  facts but no multiplicative-weights/regret engine. Direct `FinDist` use in
  `GameTheory.Math` is rejected by the existing forbidden-import check. The
  successful split proves normalized finite-vector mathematics independently,
  packages it with `FinDist.ofWeights` in Probability, and composes it only in
  `Analysis.Learning`; the original direct-`FinDist` prediction is therefore
  narrowed rather than rewritten.
- **Measurements:** the new law-free module, adapter, and bridge are 227, 49,
  and 197 nonblank lines. Core learning grows from 133 to 301 nonblank lines,
  but its added product-law/normalization layer contains no `Real.exp` or
  `Real.log`. The integrated build completes in 2,079 jobs, including the
  Analysis-owned concrete witness, and the full project builds in 3,371 jobs;
  23/23 pinned math
  and 15/15 self-play declarations are reviewed. Source hazards are zero and
  the headline theorems use only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and
  `Quot.sound`.
- **Outcome:** supports the game-independent proof spine and finite MW
  self-play, while deciding D21's vector/adapter/analytic-bridge split. Core
  rejects the MW modules; the bridge positively reaches Core averaging,
  independent regret, the canonical-law adapter, and the quantitative game
  theorem, while rejecting Protocol and the fixed-point dependency.
- **Next action:** keep finite/MW self-play closed and recover potential-game
  fictitious play as the next D-LEARN package; reserve a new experiment only
  if its convergence statement needs a boundary not already covered by D21.

### EXP-050: finite stochastic games and uniform equilibrium

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-02, working tree based on `c3197a2`; active
  source branch `uniform-existence` audited at `e7730a1`
- **Status:** supports the native-data/Protocol split; decides and promotes D22
- **Decision / question:** D0/D4/D6/D9/D11/D12 and the mature finite-stochastic
  blind spot; whether the source branch's basic stochastic-game,
  finite-horizon average-payoff, and uniform-equilibrium-payoff definitions
  fit a separate opt-in stochastic root over canonical finite laws and named
  Protocol/static bridges.
- **Prediction:** finite transition and stage-utility data need no infinite
  path law. One behavioral profile can feed every finite Protocol horizon, an
  epsilon-horizon equilibrium can be a transparent specialization of the
  canonical approximate-Nash surface, and uniformity is only the quantifier
  over one profile and all sufficiently large horizons.
- **Representative slice:** a two-player, two-state simultaneous game with a
  nondegenerate transition, state-dependent utility, and full public-history
  behavioral play; prove its horizon evaluation law and the exact equivalence
  between the source-shaped epsilon-horizon inequality and canonical
  approximate Nash, then state uniform equilibrium payoff without asserting
  the open general existence conjecture.
- **Competing designs:** a native stochastic kernel with a named Protocol
  bridge; a transparent specialization carrying an `ExecutionProtocol`; or a
  repeated-game extension. The source branch's independent history runner and
  `KernelGame` hierarchy are evidence, not candidates for compatibility.
- **Measurements to collect:** Mathlib overlap; source and import closure;
  whether arbitrary initial states and nontermination fit Protocol without a
  terminal workaround; profile identity across horizons; stored capability,
  transport, law-representation, and axiom counts; focused build cost; and
  positive/negative reachability probes for the opt-in boundary.
- **Kill conditions:** the slice needs `PMF` or an infinite path measure,
  duplicates Protocol history/run semantics or equilibrium predicates, stores
  discount/finiteness irrelevant to the operation, uses raw
  `Function.update`, imports any conjecture or placeholder, or weakens the
  stable Repeated/Protocol/Analysis boundaries.
- **Evidence:** the read-only source tree is MIT licensed (Copyright (c) 2025
  Elazar Gershuni); its changing working tree and intervening branch commits
  were unrelated to the four audited stochastic/uniform files, which remained
  unchanged from `d35c1d8` through the pinned audit revision. Their reusable
  statements are finite-horizon, but their implementation uses `PMF`, raw updates, a
  parallel history distribution, obsolete `KernelGame`, stored discount, and
  an explicit `sorry` at the open general existence constructor.
- **Observation:** the native game needs only state, action, `FinDist`
  transition, and stage utility. Initial state and nonempty actions enter the
  Protocol bridge; finite players enter behavioral product laws; decidable
  player equality enters equilibrium. One canonical behavioral profile feeds
  every horizon, average payoff is canonical expected utility, and
  epsilon-horizon Nash is canonical `IsεNash`. The first candidate leaked
  proof-carrying Protocol events into the policy domain; replacing them with a
  proof-free stage record retained state/action/target data and kept legality
  and support proofs internal.
- **Measurements:** the promoted slice is split across `Stochastic.Basic`,
  `PerfectMonitoring`, `FiniteHorizon`, and `Uniform`, with an opt-in umbrella
  and a hostile Example. Its focused build completes in 1,733 jobs and the
  full project in 3,384 jobs; the
  authored closure has 17 modules and no Analysis, Repeated, Frontier, or
  Challenges import. Source hazards are zero. The audited declarations use
  only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`. Five positive
  reachability probes see every promoted layer plus canonical approximate
  Nash; two negative probes reject Repeated and the fixed-point dependency.
- **Outcome:** supports the prediction and decides D22. A stochastic game is
  native data with a named perfect-monitoring Protocol bridge, not a stored
  protocol and not a repeated-game extension. Uniform equilibrium adds only
  finite-horizon quantifiers over the canonical approximate-Nash surface.
  The source's general existence theorem and everything depending on its
  `sorry` remain absent.
- **Promotion:** `GameTheory.Stochastic` is public but opt-in. D22's
  data/bridge API is adopted; domain support remains provisional until the
  Shapley gate. Positive probes reach all four promoted layers plus canonical
  approximate Nash; negative probes reject Repeated and the fixed-point
  dependency. All four phase audits and the exact coverage audit pass.
- **Next action:** run the mature Shapley gate—discounted two-player zero-sum
  contraction and stationary value—before claiming broad stochastic-game
  support; use the uniform statement layer only for proved special cases.
- **2026-08-02 source follow-up:** a read-only audit of active branch
  `uniform-existence` at
  `81f4a98af8f9eb05c3c13d0657e81505b24e5487` found 52 stochastic files and
  roughly 34.6k added lines.  The portable definition spine is already the
  promoted D22 surface; the branch's placeholder-dependent general existence
  hierarchy remains research evidence, not code to import or port wholesale.
- **2026-08-03 certificate follow-up:** a read-only audit of the moving sibling
  at `dba3b7a1356581d676d0f432bd1cb39ade41afb5` found one additional
  placeholder-independent proof waist in
  `Concepts/Stochastic/Uniform.lean`, last changed at
  `81c60ec813348b9805b3ae26b96a3b767b9e05f9`.  The stable successor adapts
  finite-horizon epsilon monotonicity, the named uniform deviation-cap
  constructor, its half-accuracy soundness theorem, and its exact equivalence
  with semantic uniform-equilibrium payoff.  It does not adapt the sibling's
  `sorry`-tainted `exists_uniformDeviationCapConstructor` or any dependent
  existence statement, adds no Analysis/asymptotic dependency, and credits no
  bootstrap declaration.  The focused 1,732-job and full 3,422-job builds pass;
  Phase 2, Phase 3, and exact coverage audits return `VERIFIED=1`, and the four
  adapted declarations use only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and
  `Quot.sound`.

### EXP-051: discounted stochastic games and the Shapley boundary

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-02, working tree based on `1a1831d`
- **Status:** supports the one-way normalized Analysis bridge; decides D23
- **Decision / question:** D2/D4/D9/D12/D22 and the mature stochastic-game
  gate; whether an Analysis-owned statewise finite matrix value over canonical
  `FinDist` transitions yields the discounted Shapley contraction and unique
  stationary value without widening the stable stochastic root.
- **Prediction:** the stochastic data remain unchanged and topology remains a
  one-way Analysis dependency. Existing finite minimax and saddle-point
  uniqueness should supply a canonical one-shot value whose entrywise
  one-Lipschitz law combines with finite-law expectation to make the Shapley
  operator a contraction with constant `beta`.
- **Representative slice:** two players, two states, two actions at each state,
  state-dependent zero-sum stage utility, and a genuinely nondegenerate
  transition; prove the operator contraction and a unique fixed point/Bellman
  equation for `0 ≤ beta < 1`.
- **Competing designs:** define the statewise value from the existing
  `Analysis.Minimax` saddle point; extract reusable matrix-value mathematics
  into `GameTheory.Math`; or port the active sibling branch's separate
  `Math.Minimax`/Shapley stack.
- **Measurements to collect:** Mathlib overlap and import closure; the size of
  any reusable value layer; whether saddle points prove value independence and
  entrywise Lipschitz directly; required finiteness/nonemptiness assumptions;
  build cost; axiom profile; and positive/negative reachability probes.
- **Kill conditions:** a second probability or equilibrium representation;
  `PMF`, `Fintype.ofFinite`, or stored discount/finiteness; topology leaking
  into `GameTheory.Stochastic`; dependency on the active sibling tree; failure
  to prove value independence or the Lipschitz bound from trusted theorems; or
  user-visible transport plumbing.
- **Observation:** the existing saddle-point inequalities prove matrix-value
  nonexpansiveness directly by crossing the selected row half of one saddle
  with the column half of another. No simplex optimizer or new minimax stack is
  needed. Mathlib's `ContractingWith` then supplies the unique fixed point on
  the finite-state sup metric.
- **Convention result:** the sibling prototype's unnormalized
  `u + beta * E[v]` operator was not copied. The promoted operator uses
  `(1 - beta) * u + beta * E[v]`, matching stable Repeated payoffs and keeping
  bounded values on their original scale for later vanishing-discount work.
- **Audit finding:** the first promoted split defined `Game.IsZeroSum` but the
  operator consumed only player zero's payoff, leaving the predicate dead.
  The strong integration audit added `auxiliaryUtility_one_eq`, which uses the
  predicate to identify the artificial matrix column utility with the actual
  normalized player-one return and negated continuation value. Positive probes
  name that theorem, not merely the imported predicate. The same audit also
  disproved the direct-import inference that the bridge was Mathlib-only:
  `MatrixValue` reuses `Analysis.Minimax`, whose proof closure intentionally
  reaches D12's Kakutani/Nash dependency. The first combined stable probe also
  exposed an audit-parser defect: the unknown negative
  `Game.shapleyOperator` was treated as evidence that its `Game` namespace
  prefix was unknown. Adding an identifier boundary repaired the matcher
  without weakening the positive probe.
- **Measurements:** the 329-nonblank-line experiment promoted into
  `Stochastic.ZeroSum`, `Analysis.MatrixValue`, and the one-way
  `Analysis.Stochastic` bridge plus its hostile Example. The seven-target
  focused build completed in 3,122 jobs (17.3 seconds). Stable Stochastic
  rejects the Shapley operator; the analytic bridge reaches the canonical
  matrix value, `FinDist`, zero-sum interpretation, contraction, and stationary
  saddle selector plus the existing Kakutani/minimax path while rejecting
  Protocol and Repeated. Source hazards are zero, and headline axioms are
  exactly `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- **Outcome:** supports design 1 and decides D23. Statewise stationary saddle
  actions and the normalized Bellman value are public behind Analysis;
  arbitrary infinite-history optimality and the general uniform-existence
  conjecture remain explicitly unclaimed.
- **Next action:** use the admitted stochastic waist for finite-horizon or
  checked special-case results; reserve a new experiment before adding an
  infinite-path payoff law or a vanishing-discount existence theorem.

### EXP-052: welfare smoothness and the congestion boundary

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-02, working tree based on `9e35ab1`
- **Status:** supports Core ownership; decides and promotes D24
- **Decision / question:** D0/D4/D5/D9 and the first shared welfare consumer;
  whether social welfare and smoothness are canonical `UtilityGame` facts in
  Core, a separate stable welfare root, or congestion-local infrastructure.
- **Prediction:** social welfare is a finite sum of canonical expected
  utilities, and a smoothness-to-Nash bound needs no new game, equilibrium,
  ratio, or probability semantics.  The generic theorem belongs at the lowest
  stable layer; affine congestion should import it one way.
- **Representative slice:** recover the pure affine-congestion smoothness
  certificate and its `5/2` social-cost bound, then anchor it to a nontrivial
  Pigou or Braess congestion instance.
- **Competing designs:** `Core.Welfare`; an opt-in `GameTheory.Welfare` root;
  or a congestion-local definition.  The pinned generic price-of-anarchy ratio
  hierarchy is not a candidate for this first slice.
- **Measurements to collect:** Mathlib overlap, import closure, public surface
  size, theorem-local finiteness/equality assumptions, the baseline declaration reuse,
  source hazards, build cost, axiom profile, and whether later CCE/no-regret
  consumers can reuse the definition without entering this first theorem.
- **Kill conditions:** a duplicate Nash or utility predicate, stored finite
  capability, raw `Function.update`, total-division ratio API, cost/welfare sign
  ambiguity, an import cycle, Analysis leakage, or failure of the affine
  congestion theorem to use the generic statement transparently.
- **Observation:** the generic surface is 46 nonblank lines and imports only
  `Core.Utility`.  The 140-line affine consumer proves the CK inequality,
  deviation-cost aggregation, sign conversion, and `5/2` bound without a ratio
  API or analytic dependency.  Pigou and Braess recover all 17 pinned example
  declarations through the same canonical profile and Nash surface.
- **Measurements:** the focused public-root build completes in 1,744 jobs.
  The full project build completes in 3,395 jobs.
  Exact ledgers review 4/4 smoothness, 8/8 affine, and 17/17 example
  declarations plus the foundational social-welfare row.  Three robust CCE
  rows remain behind one named canonical
  `FinDist` expected-social-welfare gate.  Source hazards are zero and headline
  axioms are exactly `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- **Outcome:** supports design 1 and decides D24.  Core owns only social
  welfare, smoothness, and the division-free Nash inequality; congestion owns
  affine aggregation and the pure cost theorem.  No separate welfare root is
  earned.
- **Promotion:** `GameTheory.Core` exports `Core.Welfare`; the opt-in
  `GameTheory.Congestion` root exports `AffinePoA`.  The integration audit
  removed an avoidable tactic import and verified both public reachability
  paths before freeze.
- **Next action:** recover the finite-law epsilon-CCE/CCE smoothness theorem and
  affine correlated-cost corollary through the named gate; do not add the
  predecessor's generic ratio hierarchy without a separate consumer.

### EXP-053: canonical finite-law robust smoothness

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-02, working tree based on `fce311c`
- **Status:** supports the finite-law route; narrows the module dependency
- **Decision / question:** D2/D4/D5/D9/D24 follow-on; whether the three rows
  deferred by EXP-052 close through one canonical expected-social-welfare
  operation over `FinDist`, the existing epsilon/exact CCE predicates, and no
  new probability or equilibrium representation.
- **Prediction:** `Core.Welfare` can depend one way on `Core.Learning`, expose
  expected welfare as the expectation of pure social welfare, and derive both
  robust bounds by finite linearity.  The affine congestion corollary should
  then be a sign-conversion leaf theorem.
- **Representative slice:** prove the epsilon-CCE inequality with one epsilon
  per finite player, specialize it to exact CCE, and recover the pinned affine
  correlated social-cost theorem.
- **Measurements to collect:** direct import closure and cycle risk; public
  declaration count; assumptions; source hazards; exact pinned rows closed;
  focused/full build cost; phase probes; and headline axiom profile.
- **Kill conditions:** a second law, expected-utility, or CCE definition;
  `PMF`, stored finiteness, `Fintype.ofFinite`, raw `Function.update`, transport
  plumbing, Analysis leakage, an import cycle, or a congestion-specific premise
  in the generic robust theorem.
- **Observation:** the mathematical prediction passed directly: finite-support
  expectation commutes with the finite player sum, external regret supplies one
  epsilon per player, and expected affine welfare is negated expected social
  cost.  The first module placement was narrower than predicted, however:
  importing `Core.Learning` from `Core.Welfare` would invert the natural leaf
  dependency for pure-welfare consumers.  A theorem-only `Core.RobustWelfare`
  leaf above both modules preserves the same public namespace and Core root.
- **Measurements:** `Core.Welfare` is 68 nonblank lines and still imports only
  `Core.Utility`; `Core.RobustWelfare` is 100 nonblank lines and imports only
  Learning plus Welfare; `Congestion.AffinePoA` is 169 nonblank lines.  The
  focused public-root build completes in 1,745 jobs and the full build in 3,396.
  The three deferred pinned rows are adapted, completing Smoothness 4/4 and
  the entire congestion family 50/50.  The supporting pinned mathematics row
  for finite-sum expectation is also adapted, bringing the exact accounting to
  32 ledgers and 1,443 declarations.  No finite profile, outcome, or strategy
  carrier assumption survives from the predecessor statements.  Headline
  axioms are exactly `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.  Phase 1
  and Phase 2 audits pass; Core forbidden imports, Analysis leakage, and new
  source hazards are zero, including `TRANSPORT_CONGESTION_SOURCE=0`.
- **Outcome:** supports canonical finite-law robust smoothness and closes the
  EXP-052 gate.  Core owns expected welfare and the theorem-only robust bridge;
  congestion owns only the sign conversion and affine corollary.  No kill
  condition fired, and no generic ratio hierarchy was introduced.
- **Next action:** continue breadth recovery at the already-passed auction gate;
  treat individual rationality as the next S-WEL family rather than extending
  the completed smoothness surface speculatively.

### EXP-054: executable knapsack auction boundary

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-02, working tree based on `d595d17`
- **Status:** narrows the family; decides and promotes D25's natural solver
- **Decision / question:** D4/D9/D10 follow-on; how to separate the pinned
  knapsack file's real-valued mechanism semantics, finite allocation search,
  natural-number dynamic program, fractional/integral greedy algorithms, and
  correctness theorems without creating a second auction or probability API.
- **Prediction:** public data and feasibility belong in an opt-in Mechanism
  semantic leaf; executable algorithms use explicit finite enumerations and
  natural/rational data in a separate leaf; correctness imports both one way.
  DSIC should reuse the canonical mechanism incentive surface rather than the
  pinned wrapper stack.
- **Representative slice:** trace the welfare-maximizing binary mechanism and
  one actual dynamic-programming allocation through feasibility, optimality,
  and the final half-approximation theorem.
- **Measurements to collect:** pinned declaration/API dependency graph; use of
  `Finite` versus explicit `Fintype`; raw updates and transports; computable
  scalar boundary; executable evaluation; direct import closure; build cost;
  exact rows reusable/retired; and headline axiom profile.
- **Kill conditions:** duplicate mechanism/equilibrium semantics; hidden
  `Fintype.ofFinite` or `open Classical` in executable modules; noncomputable
  data in the claimed algorithm; raw `Function.update`; user-visible transport
  plumbing; Analysis leakage; or an approximation theorem disconnected from
  the executable allocation it claims to verify.
- **Observation:** the 71 declarations split into 16 base real semantics, nine
  fractional rows, one bid-update identity, five single-parameter mechanism
  rows, 19 natural solver rows, and 21 greedy/approximation rows.  The source
  contains 45 raw `Function.update` occurrences and 19 noncomputable public
  definitions.  Its recursive kernel computes, but its two finite-universe
  wrappers are noncomputable.  More importantly, the kernel is not memoized:
  when all items fit it makes `2^(n + 1) - 1` solver calls.  The successor must
  not retain the source's dynamic-programming name or imply a complexity bound.
- **Measurements:** the 198-nonblank-line hostile slice returns a `Finset`
  allocation from an explicit duplicate-free list, evaluates the three-item
  optimum to cardinality two, and kernel-proves the exact result `{0, 1}`.  It
  proves support, feasibility, and optimality against every supported feasible
  finite set.  The focused experiment build completes in 799 jobs; the
  promoted correctness build in 800, the mechanism umbrella in 1,733, and the
  full project in 3,405.  `Real.instAdd`, `PMF`,
  `MeasureTheory.Measure`, `stdSimplex`, and `Polynomial` are unreachable from
  the algorithm closure.  Source hazards are zero.  The algorithm uses no
  classical choice; the correctness theorems have the standard `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound` axiom profile through finite-set
  foundations.  Phase 2 passes with the new algorithm boundary probes at 7/7
  rejected and the opt-in root probes at 3/3 reached.
- **Outcome:** narrows rather than confirms the full prediction.  D25 promotes
  the 19-row natural cluster as an exact explicit-list skip/take solver plus a
  one-way correctness leaf.  `Finset` is an honest executable return type;
  arbitrary `Finset.toList` extraction is noncomputable and is not part of the
  API.  The originally promised real mechanism and final half approximation
  were not established, so EXP-054 does not close the 71-row family.
- **Next action:** reserve separate follow-ons before freezing either remaining
  surface.  The real semantic slice should recover the allocation rule,
  monotonicity, and mature truthfulness through canonical `VCGSetup`, leaving
  only exact Myerson-envelope payment identity behind M-BAYES/D11.  The
  approximation slice must validate positive weights, prefilter individually
  infeasible items, use the highest feasible singleton, certify ratio order
  and fractional optimality, and return the actual better feasible allocation
  before advertising a half bound.  The predecessor's highest-bid maximum can
  name an overweight, unattainable item and is not itself an approximation
  algorithm.

### EXP-055: explicit real knapsack allocation and canonical VCG

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-02, working tree based on `9687148`
- **Status:** supports the finite-set/pivot-VCG split; decides and promotes D26
- **Decision / question:** D4/D5/D9/D25 follow-on; whether the 16 base real
  semantic rows, welfare-maximizing allocation rule, monotonicity, and mature
  truthfulness integrate through `Finset Agent`, explicit finite universes,
  `Profile.update`, and the existing `Mechanism.Auction.VCGSetup`.
- **Prediction:** a capability-free real data record and finite-set allocation
  semantics can share the exact solver's aggregate operations.  Noncomputable
  maximization requires only an explicit finite universe.  The full-agent
  mechanism adds theorem-local `[Fintype Agent]`, proves efficiency and a
  nonconstant own-report-independent Groves offset, and obtains truthful
  ex-post Nash from canonical VCG rather than a new DSIC predicate.
- **Representative slice:** recover a chosen welfare-maximizing allocation and
  its feasibility/optimality, prove own-bid monotonicity despite arbitrary
  maximizing tie choice, instantiate `VCGSetup` with `Finset Agent` outcomes
  and an offset computed after zeroing the bidder's own report, then apply the
  existing truthfulness theorem to a nontrivial capacity-constrained instance.
- **Competing designs:** explicit `Finset` universe and allocation; ambient
  Boolean function allocation plus `[Fintype]`; a knapsack-specific mechanism
  and DSIC predicate; or canonical `VCGSetup` with a named allocation bridge.
- **Measurements to collect:** import closure; exact assumptions by operation;
  public surface; update/transport counts; maximizer tie behavior; efficiency
  and offset-independence proof cost; exact rows adapted/retired; focused/full
  build cost; reachability probes; and headline axiom profile.
- **Kill conditions:** stored or algorithm-leaking `Fintype`; a second
  mechanism, utility, dominance, or DSIC predicate; raw `Function.update`;
  duplicate Nat/Real aggregate semantics; arbitrary tie choice breaking
  monotonicity; Analysis/Protocol leakage; a constant-offset toy that does not
  test own-report independence; or truthfulness stated only outside canonical
  equilibrium semantics.
- **Observation:** efficiency quantifies over every VCG outcome, so the outcome
  carrier must be the subtype of feasible finite sets rather than every
  `Finset Agent`.  Arbitrary maximizer tie choice does not break monotonicity:
  if a strictly raised selected bidder were dropped, the low- and high-report
  optimality inequalities contradict each other.  The first hostile draft
  also exposed and then removed two kill-condition defects: a local duplicate
  bid signature and separate real aggregation operations.
- **Measurements:** scalar-generic `Aggregate` is shared independently by the
  natural `Algorithm` and real `Basic`; `Basic` stores no finiteness and does
  not import execution or VCG.  `Mechanism` uses the canonical auction report
  and `Profile.update`, adds `[Fintype Agent]` only at the full-universe
  boundary, and packages feasibility in the outcome type.  The two-agent
  capacity-one witness rejects the joint allocation, moves the pivot offset
  from zero to three under an opponent-report change, preserves it under every
  own replacement, and proves zero payment after a zero own report.  Focused
  builds complete in 1,724/1,725/1,726 jobs for Basic, Mechanism, and the
  witness; the umbrella completes in 1,728 and the full project in 3,409.
  Aggregate rejects 8/8 boundary probes, Basic rejects 7/7, and the mechanism
  root reaches 6/6 canonical update/VCG/monotonicity/Nash targets.  All four
  phase audits and coverage audit report `VERIFIED=1`.  Source hazards are
  zero; headline theorems use only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and
  `Quot.sound`.
- **Outcome:** supports the prediction and decides D26.  The family ledger is
  now 26 adapted, 12 retired, two subsumed, and 31 deferred.  The 31 are the
  nine fractional rows, 21 repaired greedy/approximation rows, and exact
  Myerson payment equality; mature truthfulness itself is recovered through
  canonical VCG and ex-post Nash.
- **Next action:** reserve the repaired approximation experiment.  Require
  positive weights, an executable certified ratio order, prefilter
  individually infeasible items, compare against the highest feasible
  singleton, prove the fractional relaxation bound, and return the actual
  better feasible `Finset` before stating a half approximation.

### EXP-056: repaired executable knapsack half approximation

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-02, working tree based on `8330724`
- **Status:** complete; supports after narrowing; decides D27
- **Decision / question:** D9/D10/D25/D26 follow-on; whether the nine pinned
  fractional rows and 21 greedy/approximation rows can become an executable
  natural-number algorithm with a theorem about the allocation it actually
  returns, rather than the predecessor's conditional maximum of two values.
- **Prediction:** after removing individually infeasible items, a duplicate-free
  explicit list carrying a checked nonincreasing value/weight ratio order can
  drive the integral greedy prefix and its fractional relaxation.  Comparing
  the greedy prefix with the highest feasible singleton returns a feasible
  `Finset`; fractional optimality and the standard split-item bound should
  prove twice its welfare dominates the exact `solveList` optimum.
- **Representative slice:** use at least three positive-weight items where the
  ratio-greedy prefix alone is suboptimal and an additional overweight,
  high-value item would invalidate the pinned `highestBidValue`.  The repaired
  frontend must discard the overweight item, evaluate to an actual allocation,
  and kernel-check feasibility plus the half bound against `solveList`.
- **Competing designs:** caller-supplied list with a checked ratio-order
  certificate; executable internal rational comparison sort plus a separate
  permutation/order proof; or a proof-only real sorter.  The returned result
  may compare greedy and singleton allocations directly, but may not expose a
  maximum value with no attaining allocation.
- **Measurements to collect:** exact pinned proof dependency graph; Mathlib
  ratio/sort overlap; assumptions needed to avoid division; evaluation and
  recurrence cost; support/feasibility; fractional relaxation and optimality;
  exact cast bridge to the natural solver; source hazards; reachability; build
  cost; axiom profile; and exact rows adapted/retired/subsumed.
- **Kill conditions:** zero weights or division-by-zero hidden by defaults;
  noncomputable sorting in an executable API; `open Classical` or hidden
  `Fintype`; a ratio-order premise not checked by the frontend; an overweight
  singleton candidate; a theorem about `max` of unattained values; a bound
  against a different feasible class from `solveList`; raw profile updates,
  user-visible transport, or real/VCG/Analysis leakage into the algorithm.
- **Artifacts / commands:**
  `GameTheory/Mechanism/Knapsack/{ApproximationAlgorithm,
  ApproximationCorrectness,Approximation}.lean`;
  `GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/KnapsackApproximation.lean`;
  `lake build GameTheory.Mechanism.Knapsack.Approximation` (828 jobs);
  `lake build GameTheory.Mechanism.Knapsack` (1,731 jobs);
  `lake build` (3,413 jobs); Phases 0/1/2/3 and coverage audits in expected
  verification mode.
- **Observations / measurements:** the pinned source contains nine fractional
  rows and 21 greedy/approximation rows, but never proves its
  fractional-greedy optimality premise.  Mathlib supplies executable merge sort
  and its permutation/pairwise theorems, not fractional-knapsack optimality.
  The successful design filters individually infeasible items, rejects
  duplicate or zero-weight raw lists, internally sorts by checked natural
  cross multiplication, and returns the better of two actual feasible
  `Finset`s.  A direct division-free exchange proof replaces the predicted
  fractional layer.  An independent exhaustive pre-check covered 3,119,265
  small instances without a counterexample.  The hostile telemetry is
  `some (false, true, 95, 1)`: the overweight item is absent, the best feasible
  singleton is returned, welfare is 95, and the allocation has one item.  The
  witness kernel-checks success, singleton selection, overweight exclusion,
  feasibility, attainment, and the exact-solver factor bound.  The new
  executable closure rejects 7/7 real/game/probability/analytic probes; the
  public root reaches 5/5 intended inputs; Phase 2 reports `VERIFIED=1`.
  The public axiom profile is only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and
  `Quot.sound`.  The family now has 33 adapted, 35 retired, two subsumed, and
  one deferred row.
- **Outcome / next action:** adopt D27.  Retire the fractional allocation,
  real-cast, ambient-highest-bid, and conditional-optimality intermediates;
  retain a separately audited natural executable leaf, structural correctness
  leaf, and ratio theorem about the returned allocation.  Exact Myerson
  payment remains behind M-BAYES/D11.  Return to the next DFS delivery gate.
- **2026-08-10 follow-up:** the original run rejected zero-weight inputs, as
  recorded above. A proof audit showed the global positive-weight premise was
  unnecessary: the only rejected-item use derives positivity from
  `remaining < weight`. The checker now requires only duplicate freedom, the
  generic half bound accepts zero weights, and a zero-weight hostile guard and
  EXP-056 witness build. D27 records this proof-driven narrowing without
  rewriting the original experiment observation.

### EXP-057: FOSG observation ownership and native Kuhn retirement

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-02, working tree based on `c104963`
- **Status:** complete; supports; decides D28
- **Decision / question:** whether the 39 pinned declarations in
  `Languages/FOSG/Native/{History,HistoryMarginal}.lean` expose FOSG-specific
  mathematics that survives D6/D15, or whether the mature Kuhn payload should
  be a thin FOSG-facing specialization of the canonical Protocol information
  model while the native runner and bridge machinery retire.
- **Prediction:** the existing `InformationModel` laws already subsume both
  directions at full `FinDist History` equality.  FOSG may earn transparent
  aliases and named history/outcome-law theorems, but no second history,
  strategy carrier, product law, execution state, step invariant hierarchy, or
  runner.  Changing only the observation signals on one execution should
  switch applicability of the named recall/no-revisit hypotheses and hence which theorem
  applies.
- **Representative slice:** reuse the two-vote Protocol in
  `GameTheory/Tests/Randomized.lean`: its forgetful signals fail perfect recall,
  while recalling signals on the identical states/actions/transitions prove
  perfect recall and one-action-per-relevant-information-state.  Package the
  latter as a real FOSG and reach both named Kuhn directions, complete
  history-law equality, and an arbitrary outcome pushforward through the
  canonical runner.
- **Competing designs:** port the pinned `ObsModelCore` plus native-history PMF
  runner; expose no FOSG-facing theorem at all and require callers to project
  every field manually; or provide a theorem-only `FOSG.Kuhn` leaf whose
  statements reduce to `InformationModel` laws.  A later named FOSG-to-EFG
  comparison remains a separate batch.
- **Measurements to collect:** exact dependency clusters and row
  dispositions; import and source-hazard surface; assumptions on both Kuhn
  directions; whether the hostile signal change is expressible without
  changing execution; build and audit cost; axiom profile; and whether any
  consumer needs the old step-coefficient or posterior-locality predicates.
- **Kill conditions:** a FOSG-specific runner, history, or strategy definition;
  stored/global finiteness; `Fintype.ofFinite`; raw `Function.update`; public
  casts/`HEq`; PMF/`ObsModelCore` compatibility machinery; weaker or conflated
  hypotheses than the canonical no-revisit and recall conditions; syntax-root
  reachability of solution concepts; or claiming the separately gated
  counterfactual-reach/CFR and continuation-coefficient spines.
- **Artifacts / commands:**
  `GameTheory/Languages/FOSG/Kuhn.lean`;
  `GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/FOSGKuhn.lean`;
  `GameTheory/Tests/Randomized.lean`;
  `lake build GameTheory.Experimental.PostArchitecture.FOSGKuhn` (1,724
  jobs); `lake build` (3,415 jobs); Phase 2 static, Phase 3 full reachability,
  and coverage audits in expected verification mode.
- **Observations / measurements:** the 39 pinned native history/marginal rows
  divide into 13 adaptations, seven subsumptions, and 19 retirements.  The
  mature content is already stronger at the canonical layer:
  `InformationModel.runMixed_toMixed` and `runMixed_toBehavioral` prove equality
  of complete `FinDist History` laws, so the old scalar `marginal_prob` follows
  by point evaluation.  The FOSG leaf adds only transparent plan/signature
  abbreviations and five named theorem families: both directions, realizable
  history-law equality, and both arbitrary outcome pushforwards.  It defines
  no runner, history, execution state, strategy carrier, or product law.
  The hostile artifact checks three distinct cases on existing Protocol data:
  repeating forgetful information violates acts-once and produces unequal
  behavioral/mixed mapped laws; a one-move model satisfies acts-once but not
  perfect recall and still reaches the behavioral-to-mixed theorem; recalling
  signals on the original two-move execution discharge both named hypotheses
  and all FOSG-facing results.  The syntax root rejects the Kuhn flagship while
  the opt-in leaf reaches 5/5 named results and rejects EFG 1/1; Phase 3 reports
  `VERIFIED=1`.  Source scans find no placeholder, custom axiom, transport,
  raw update, `Fintype.ofFinite`, EFG/utility import, PMF bridge, or
  `ObsModelCore`.  Public axioms are only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and
  `Quot.sound`.
- **Outcome / next action:** adopt D28.  Keep FOSG Kuhn as a theorem-only
  projection of `G.information`; retire the native runner, invariant hierarchy,
  bridge conversions, finite-instance surface, and marginal proof spine.  The
  exact L-FOSG queue is now 372/776 reviewed with 404 rows remaining.  Review
  `ReachableHistory/ObsModelFacts.lean` next without crediting its separately
  gated counterfactual/CFR content; reserve a distinct experiment for the
  simultaneous stochastic FOSG-to-EFG serialization comparison.

### EXP-058: FOSG reachable-observation adapter retirement

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-02, working tree based on `f926bec`
- **Status:** complete; supports retirement; decides D29
- **Decision / question:** whether any of the 46 pinned declarations in
  `Languages/FOSG/ReachableHistory/ObsModelFacts.lean` survives as stable FOSG
  observation theory after D6/D15/D28 removed the reachable-history
  `ObsModelCore` machine.
- **Prediction:** outcome laws and action-record extension already have
  canonical Protocol owners.  Raw view decoding, terminal-menu facts,
  alternate-run invariants, posterior-locality adapters, and strategy lifts
  should retire rather than constrain the accepted execution/information API.
- **Representative slice:** a terminal-initial Protocol deliberately keeps its
  sole player active and gives it two Boolean local choices; execution still
  stops without consulting a chooser, machine-refuting terminal-choice
  subsingleton.  The existing one-move `Repeat.singleSignals` witness reaches
  the same compressed information state after distinct own actions and
  refutes perfect recall, so raw observation-list cancellation cannot become
  a general information-state theorem.
- **Competing designs:** port the 1,292-line adapter and its reachable-only
  carriers; leave all rows open pending future counterfactual work; or classify
  the file against current Protocol owners while reserving genuinely new CFR
  work for a theorem stated on the canonical runner.  The third design wins.
- **Measurements:** 1,233 nonblank lines and 46 declarations.  Raw source-token
  counts are 128 `ObsModelCore`, 47 `PMF`, 32 `ParameterizedChain`, 19
  `Function.update`, 24 `change`, 20 `▸`, three `HEq`, one
  `Fintype.ofFinite`, 15 `classical`, and nine noncomputable definitions.
  Only `ReachableHistory/Law.lean` and its umbrella import the file directly;
  the law file consumes its posterior-locality and lift machinery for the
  native mixed/behavioral and equilibrium-transfer spine.
- **Artifacts / commands:**
  `GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/FOSGObservationFacts.lean`;
  `lake build GameTheory.Experimental.PostArchitecture.FOSGObservationFacts`
  (1,724 jobs); `lake build` (3,416 jobs); Phase 2 static and exact ledger /
  coverage audits in expected verification mode.
- **Kill conditions:** retain no survivor that mentions `ObsModelCore`, a
  reachable-only strategy carrier, scalar PMF execution, raw observation
  lists, terminal inactivity, global finiteness, raw updates, or public
  transport; credit no CFR theorem merely because downstream retired code used
  this adapter.
- **Observation:** the terminal counterexample compiles against the canonical
  interfaces and the compressed-information counterexample was already part
  of the D28 hostile suite.  `InformationModel.runBehavioral`, `run`, and
  `InfoSignals.ownPlay_extend` own the three reusable results.  The remaining
  declarations are interfaces or proof steps for a second machine, including
  the posterior-locality result; none is a counterfactual/CFR theorem itself.
- **Outcome / next action:** adopt D29; classify the file 2 adapt / 1 subsumed /
  43 retired and add no stable declaration.  Run the separately named
  simultaneous stochastic FOSG-to-EFG serialization comparison next.  Any
  later counterfactual/CFR recovery must start from the canonical history law
  and earn its own checked theorem gate.

### EXP-059: hidden-phase FOSG-to-EFG serialization

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-02, working tree based on `698d0eb`
- **Status:** complete; supports explicit hidden-phase serialization; decides D30
- **Question / designs:** compare the pinned separate serial-FOSG machine,
  prefix erasure or disclosure, and an explicit-order EFG whose execution state
  retains the prefix while its information state exposes only the microstep.
- **Hostile slice:** two simultaneous Boolean players plus a fair Boolean
  transition, compiled in both player orders.  Distinct stored first choices
  give the later mover equal information; both actions and the coin separately
  change the full terminal outcome.
- **Measurements:** 1,320 nonblank lines and 108 declarations; only EFG/FOSG
  imports; focused build 1,723 jobs.  Source/target policy maps are inverse at
  reached decision sites; literal target-history erasure equals the canonical
  source-history law for every target profile; both orders preserve it.
- **Integration:** full build 3,417 jobs; Phase 2 static, Phase 3 static, and
  exact coverage audits report `VERIFIED=1`.
- **Audit:** no placeholders, custom axioms, raw updates, `Fintype.ofFinite`,
  `open Classical`, or transport tokens.  Audited theorems use only `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.  Generic single-mover behavioral-joint
  facts moved from MAID to their Protocol owner.
- **Outcome / next action:** adopt D30's feasibility result but do not promote
  a generic API yet.  Reserve a two-round stochastic explicit-order experiment
  covering source signal replay, own-action memory, inactive slots, arbitrary
  target projection, and exact scaled canonical-history laws.  Do not port the
  unrelated pinned `FOSG.Serial` machine.

### EXP-060: two-round FOSG-to-EFG source-signal replay

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-02, working tree based on `1dec799`
- **Status:** complete; supports D30 through two-round replay and unblocks a
  generic explicit-order implementation without promoting one yet
- **Decision / question:** whether D30's hidden microstep design composes over
  source rounds when the next source decision depends on nontrivial
  public/private resolution signals, rather than only on a phase tag.
- **Prediction:** target execution may retain the partial within-round joint,
  but target information must replay source signals only after resolution.
  Erasing every block of `order.length + 1` target histories should recover the
  canonical source history law without default-valued outcome projection.
- **Representative hostile slice:** two Boolean players and two stochastic
  rounds.  The first resolution produces a public signal and distinct private
  signals including own-action memory; the second round contains an inactive
  player slot.  A second-round policy changes with the replayed source signal,
  while distinct hidden first-mover choices remain information-equivalent
  inside each serialized round.
- **Competing designs:** promote a generic compiler from the one-round result;
  add a concrete two-round replay layer over canonical Protocol histories; or
  port the pinned separate serial-FOSG execution machine.  The experiment tests
  the middle design and keeps the other two blocked.
- **Measurements:** 2,308 nonblank lines and 172 declarations across the main
  slice and direct witnesses; imports only stable `Languages.EFG` and
  `Languages.FOSG`.  The source is deliberately non-tree-shaped: distinct
  first-round joints merge at one state while source information retains their
  different traces.  The target is tree-shaped and carries the exact
  `Source.execution.History` through two fixed-width player slots and a
  resolver per source round.
- **Information and policy tests:** selection signals are administrative and
  leave the full policy-visible source component unchanged.  Only the resolver
  replays the exact source public signal, private signal, and own source
  choice.  Named reached `infoOf` witnesses cover inactive-versus-active and
  alternate-action hiding, while a concrete second-round policy changes with
  the public bit, opponent-private report, and remembered own action.
- **Law tests:** the three-target-step/one-source-step boundary theorem and the
  composed six-target-step/two-source-step theorem quantify over every target
  behavioral profile and preserve literal canonical source histories.
  Projection followed by translation is the identity on every source view;
  forward translation, both fixed orders, and arbitrary-profile transport
  between either pair of orders preserve the same history law.
- **Integration:** the focused main-and-witness build completes warning-free at
  1,724 jobs and the full build completes at 3,419 jobs.  Phase 2, Phase 3,
  and exact-coverage audits each report `VERIFIED=1`; exact coverage matches all
  1,573 ledger rows with zero missing or duplicate declarations.
- **Audit:** no placeholders, custom axioms, raw updates,
  `Fintype.ofFinite`, `open Classical`, or source-level transport tokens.
  Public axiom prints for the source counterexample, target tree theorem,
  arbitrary-profile history laws, full-info witness, and signal-sensitive
  policy use only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- **Kill conditions:** any second execution/history/strategy carrier; exposing
  a prior within-round action through target information; replaying a source
  signal before its source transition; relying on a default terminal outcome;
  raw `Function.update`, public transport plumbing, global finite instances,
  placeholders, custom axioms, or weakening the canonical runner contract.
- **Artifacts / commands:**
  `GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/FOSGToEFGTwoRound.lean`;
  `GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/FOSGToEFGTwoRoundWitnesses.lean`;
  their narrow Lake targets; `scripts/phase2-audit.ps1`;
  `scripts/phase3-audit.ps1`; `git diff --check`; full `lake build`;
  embedded `#print axioms` commands.
- **Outcome / next action:** no kill condition fired.  D30's hidden-phase
  design composes across stochastic source rounds, exact source-signal replay,
  own-action memory, and inactive slots.  Implement and validate the generic
  explicit-order adapter next, then account the pinned live bridge chain.  Do
  not claim stable bridge coverage from this concrete Bool experiment, and
  keep counterfactual reach, CFR, and ordinary continuation coefficients behind
  their separate gates.

### EXP-061: generic explicit-order FOSG-to-EFG bridge

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-02, reserved on `4af78de`
- **Status:** complete; supports the generic explicit-order bridge and completes
  D30's public-API gate
- **Question:** whether the hidden microstep construction validated by
  EXP-059/060 generalizes over the canonical FOSG and EFG carriers without a
  second execution semantics, global finiteness, default outcomes, or public
  transport plumbing.
- **Prediction:** an explicit duplicate-free player order, source history, and
  partial legal joint should suffice to serialize each source round into one
  selection slot per ordered player plus one resolver.  Target information
  should expose only the current phase and canonical source information; exact
  source histories and signals should be replayed only at resolution.
- **Representative slice:** migrate the hostile non-tree-shaped two-round
  EXP-060 source through the generic construction, including inactive slots,
  source-signal-sensitive policies, arbitrary target-profile projection, and
  two distinct explicit orders.
- **Competing designs:** a generic bounded compiler over explicit orders; a
  theorem-only construction specialized per game; or promotion of the pinned
  separate `FOSG.Serial` semantics.  The last design remains excluded by D30;
  the experiment distinguishes the first two by API and proof cost.
- **Observations / measurements:** duplicate-freedom alone is insufficient: an order
  that omits a player cannot assemble a legal simultaneous source joint.  The
  promoted bridge therefore represents a schedule by an explicit equivalence
  `Fin slots ≃ ι`, enforcing exhaustiveness and no duplicates by construction
  while storing no `Fintype` instance.  Empty player types remain supported.
  The independent-draw blocker is discharged by reusable
  `FinDist.runDependent_eq_pi`: sequential dependent assignment over any
  duplicate-free exhaustive list equals canonical `FinDist.pi`.
  The stable bridge is 1,879 nonblank lines with 114 syntactic declarations;
  39 proof-spine declarations are private.  Its only imports are stable
  `Languages.EFG` and `Languages.FOSG`.  The 217-nonblank-line migrated witness
  checks both Boolean orders, within-round hiding, hidden inactive versus active
  slots, resolver replay of public/private/own-action information, and a
  translated policy sensitive to all three signal coordinates.  The exact law
  quantifies over every target behavioral profile and round count; literal
  erased target histories equal canonical source histories.  The focused build
  completed 1,727 jobs warning-free; the full integration build completed
  3,422 jobs.  Phase 2, Phase 3, and exact coverage audits all returned
  `VERIFIED=1`, including the expected positive and negative reachability
  probes.  Embedded axiom prints report only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and
  `Quot.sound`.
- **Kill conditions:** inability to state exact canonical history laws without
  reconstruction or defaults; information leakage from partial joints;
  strategy projection that depends on unreachable guesses; stored global
  `Fintype`/`Finite` assumptions; synthetic players; user-visible transports;
  a second runner/history carrier; placeholders, custom axioms, or forbidden
  dependencies.
- **Artifacts / commands:** stable
  `GameTheory/Languages/Bridges/FOSGToEFG.lean`; EXP-060 migrated witnesses;
  focused build; Phase 2 and Phase 3 audits; exact coverage audit; full build;
  embedded axiom prints for the public laws.
- **Outcome / next action:** no kill condition fired.  The immediate
  breadth-first follow-up accounts all 104 declarations in the pinned
  `SerialExec` → `AugmentedEFG` → `EFG_FOSG` chain: 11 adapt, 27 subsumed, 47
  retired, and 19 explicitly deferred.  Only one additional stable theorem was
  justified: `translate_project_profile` upgrades the scheduled inverse to a
  full target-profile inverse because every non-owner and resolver menu is a
  certified singleton.  The pinned PMF runner, global-finiteness, manual
  reindexing, legalization, and separate serial semantics remain retired.
  Counterfactual reach, CFR, ordinary continuation coefficients, augmentation,
  strategic/utility transfer, and language expressiveness retain their own
  gates.

### EXP-062: intrinsic games ownership and closed-loop causality

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-03, reserved on `6c37ac8`
- **Status:** complete; supports a native intrinsic root and
  configuration-dependent causality surface
- **Decision / question:** whether the pinned finite Witsenhausen-style
  intrinsic model retains theorem-relevant product/configuration information
  that cannot be represented honestly by the canonical Protocol history and
  information layers before a temporal ordering/compiler is selected.
- **Prediction:** a minimal native configuration carrier, agent-indexed
  decision functions constant on information setoid classes, closed-loop
  fixed-point solvability, and configuration-dependent causality can express
  both a solvability theorem and a future-information counterexample that bare
  Protocol cannot state without prematurely fixing an execution order.  No
  utility, equilibrium, PMF runner, or Kuhn theorem is needed for that test.
- **Representative slice:** reconstruct the pinned trivial-information
  two-agent solvability witness and the `futureLookingModel` causality
  rejection on capability-light data.  Then test the full representation with
  a nonconstant three-agent schedule whose configuration cell and predecessor
  agreement are independently necessary for the positive causality theorem.
- **Competing designs:** a native intrinsic configuration/information root with
  later named compilation; direct encoding as Protocol after an explicit
  ordering, retiring the intrinsic branch; or a theorem-only fixed-point
  construction over existing generic data with no game-language surface.
- **Kill conditions:** every hostile statement reduces transparently to an
  existing Protocol theorem; the slice needs stored global finiteness, PMF,
  KernelGame, duplicate equilibrium/behavioral strategy semantics, raw profile
  updates, public transports, or a chosen temporal execution merely to state
  causality; the future-looking fixture fails to distinguish the designs; or
  trusted code needs placeholders/custom axioms/forbidden imports.
- **Artifacts / commands:**
  `GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/IntrinsicOwnership.lean` (357
  nonblank lines, 39 declarations); `lake env lean
  GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/IntrinsicOwnership.lean`; source
  hazard scan; printed axiom profiles; independent Sol audit with compiling
  counterexamples to both premise-erased causality variants.  The artifact
  imports only `Mathlib.Logic.Equiv.Bool`.
- **Observations:** universal information proves unique simultaneous
  closed-loop solutions for every pure profile and nature state.  A first
  mover that observes a later decision is noncausal before Protocol exists.
  `Fin slots ≃ Agent` packages exhaustive duplicate-free scheduling without
  stored global finiteness.  `SamePrefixThrough` matches direct `PrefixCell`
  membership through the current slot.  The final three-agent witness is
  genuinely nonconstant, and concrete configuration pairs show that neither
  prefix-cell agreement nor predecessor agreement implies the other; the
  positive proof needs both.  Axiom profiles contain only `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound` as applicable, and the hazard audit is
  empty.
- **Outcome / next action:** **supports**; D31 adopts a capability-light native
  configuration/model/pure-strategy/solvability root and the explicit-slot
  causality surface.  Promote them with independent universes, then classify
  the pinned `Syntax.lean` batch exactly.  Temporal compilation, perfect
  recall, mixed/behavioral strategies, PMF outcome laws, ownership/utility,
  equilibrium, and Kuhn remain separate gates.

### EXP-063: Lean and Mathlib 4.32.2 compatibility gate

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-03, reserved on `d58fc8d`
- **Status:** complete; supports the patch upgrade and metadata-only maintained
  fork repin
- **Decision / question:** whether the project and its pinned external
  fixed-point dependency remain warning-free, kernel-auditable, and within the
  enforced import boundaries after moving the root Lean and Mathlib pins from
  `v4.32.0` to the stable `v4.32.2` patch release.
- **Prediction:** Lake resolves one root Mathlib revision at `v4.32.2`; the
  fixed-point package's older advertised `v4.32.0` pins do not create a second
  Mathlib or prevent its Brouwer/Kakutani modules from compiling; all current
  build, trust, reachability, and coverage gates remain unchanged.
- **Representative slice:** resolve the full manifest, fetch the matching
  Mathlib cache, build the two fixed-point modules first, then compile every
  GameTheory/GameTheory.Math submodule and run the complete phase and bootstrap
  coverage audits.
- **Kill conditions:** dependency resolution retains or introduces a second
  Mathlib revision; the fixed-point dependency fails on `v4.32.2`; any trusted
  theorem gains `sorryAx` or a custom axiom; warnings, source hazards, expected
  positive/negative reachability probes, or exact coverage accounting regress.
- **Artifacts / commands:** `lean-toolchain`, `lakefile.lean`, generated
  `lake-manifest.json`; `lake update`; `lake env lean --version`; `lake exe cache
  get`; focused fixed-point builds; full build; Phase 0--3 and coverage audits;
  kernel axiom prints.
- **Intervention / repin:** the accepted upstream pin still advertised a fixed
  `v4.32.0` toolchain, so Lake reported competing fixed-toolchain candidates.
  The dependency was repinned to the user-maintained
  `elazarg/fixed-point-theorems-lean4@9571dd7e0ff0af9c9e9becb2738a309cf48387c1`.
  Relative to `harfe/fixed-point-theorems-lean4@770940ddf9878cf61952ed53d910b92bca841838`,
  all six theorem-source files and the root Lean source are byte-identical.  The
  upstream MIT license was retained byte-for-byte; only toolchain and generated
  dependency metadata otherwise differ.
- **Observations / measurements:** the first attempt in the active the baseline checkout
  exposed untracked generated files inside its ignored Mathlib clone, so it was
  preserved and the validation was restarted in a clean clone.  Intermittent
  GitHub HTTPS failures required retries but did not change resolution.  The
  clean dependency clone resolved one Mathlib at `v4.32.2` / `905b958`, fetched
  its cache, built 3,050 jobs, and passed its axiom audit; it has no configured
  `lake test` driver.  The root resolver subsequently completed through the
  ordinary GitHub URL with no toolchain-skew warning, `lake exe cache get`
  reported 8,639 artifacts present, the focused Brouwer/Kakutani/Nash build
  completed 3,101 jobs, and the full repository build completed 3,430 jobs.
  `brouwer_fixed_point`, `kakutani_fixed_point`, and
  `GameTheory.exists_isNash_mixed` each report exactly `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.  Phase 0 reproduced its frozen source
  measurements, and Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, and exact bootstrap coverage all
  returned `VERIFIED=1`; in particular `FIXED_POINT_IMPORTERS=1`,
  `ANALYSIS_PROBES_REACHED=2`, `SORRY_OR_ADMIT=0`, and `CUSTOM_AXIOM=0`.
- **Outcome / next action:** no kill condition fired.  D12 records the new
  immutable provenance and zero toolchain skew; retain the maintained fork's
  metadata in lockstep with future root toolchain bumps, and keep the original
  EXP-023 measurements as historical evidence.

### EXP-064: discounted public-monitoring equilibrium waist

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-03, reserved on `2041354`
- **Status:** complete
- **Decision / question:** whether finite public-signal prefixes support
  discounted continuation values, canonical perfect-public equilibrium, and a
  one-shot-deviation equivalence without an infinite realized-path law or a
  second equilibrium predicate.
- **Prediction:** stagewise expectation over `signalHistoryLaw`, followed by an
  ordinary normalized real series, defines the payoff.  A deterministic
  monitored-strategy form lets discounted public Nash reuse `IsNash` and
  `euPreferenceWithin`; PPE is that same condition after every finite public
  history.  For `0 ≤ δ < 1` and bounded stage payoffs, PPE is equivalent to no
  profitable one-shot deviation after every public history.
- **Representative slice:** a noisy finite public-monitoring game whose second
  signal law and prescribed continuation both depend on the first realized
  signal, with nonconstant stage utility and a genuine unilateral action
  comparison.  The generic theorem must specialize to this fixture without
  perfect observation or a deterministic signal process.
- **Competing designs:** stagewise finite expectations plus a real series over
  the existing monitored profile; a new infinite-path probability semantics;
  or a standalone repeated-equilibrium inequality disconnected from canonical
  `IsNash`.
- **Kill conditions:** any need for a `FinDist`/measure on infinite signal
  paths; a duplicate Nash/deviation/profile-update semantics; stored global
  finiteness or topology in `PublicMonitoring`; direct `Function.update`;
  signal-history transports visible in the public API; or an equivalence that
  only works for deterministic/perfect monitoring or vacuous payoffs.
- **Artifacts / commands:** the four `GameTheory/Repeated/Monitoring*.lean`
  leaves, `GameTheory/Tests/MonitoringEquilibrium.lean`, and the focused
  D-REPEAT ledger.  The focused
  targets were `GameTheory.Repeated` and
  `GameTheory.Tests.MonitoringEquilibrium`; the release gate used the full
  build, Phase 2/3 audits, and exact coverage audit recorded below.
- **Observations / measurements:** arbitrary continuations and finite
  deviations stayed cast-free and use only `Profile.update`.  Finite-support
  expectation made the stage-payoff tower law strictly cleaner than the baseline: it
  needs no boundedness premise.  Discounted public Nash is literally `IsNash`
  on the deterministic monitored form; PPE and one-shot optimality quantify
  over every typed finite history, including zero-probability histories.  The
  exact sufficiency proof did not need the comparison design's approximate accumulated-allowance
  detour: induction controls finite truncations and dominated convergence
  reaches an arbitrary public deviation.  No player, strategy, signal, or
  outcome finiteness is stored or assumed; only `0 ≤ discount < 1` and a
  per-player uniform absolute stage-payoff bound enter sufficiency.
- **Hostile result:** the two-player Boolean coordination fixture has a fair
  root signal, a deterministic successor kernel after `true`, nonconstant
  utility, and a strict unilateral current-action loss.  It proves that the
  typed history `[true,false]` has generated mass zero, computes its stationary
  all-true continuation, proves one-shot optimality after every typed history,
  and derives an actual PPE at discount `1/2` through the generic equivalence.
- **Trust / outcome:** no kill condition fired.  Both the Bellman theorem and
  the final one-shot equivalence print exactly `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.  The public root and hostile fixture
  build warning-free, and the full repository build completes 3,437 jobs.
  The full Phase 3 audit returns `VERIFIED=1`, including three rejected and two
  reached repeated-boundary probes.  Phase 2's full reachability run passed
  every probe but caught four source-level `change` tokens; after replacing
  them with definitional unfolding/`show`, its structural rerun reports
  `TRANSPORT_REPEATED_SOURCE=0`, `TRANSPORT_PHASE3_SOURCE=0`,
  `FUNCTION_UPDATE_OUTSIDE_PROFILE=0`, `SORRY_OR_ADMIT=0`,
  `CUSTOM_AXIOM=0`, and `VERIFIED=1`.  Exact coverage reports 8,324 pinned
  declarations, 44 qualitative capability rows, a current generated index,
  no ledger/capability mismatch, and `VERIFIED=1`.  EXP-064 supports D11's
  finite-prefix boundary and closes the critical monitoring-equilibrium gap.
  Approximate allowances, garbling breadth, rank/self-generation, and uniform
  results return to dependency-gated D-REPEAT harvesting; private-history
  deviations or a stochastic Protocol compiler require a separate experiment.

### EXP-065: finite hidden-action contract ownership

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-03, reserved on `abf5901`
- **Status:** complete; supports native finite-support ownership
- **Decision / question:** whether the pinned hidden-action model earns a
  native `Mechanism` branch over action-indexed `FinDist` outcome laws, or
  should be encoded as a one-player `GameForm` or an auction specialization.
- **Prediction:** capability-free principal-agent data, expected transfers,
  an explicit outside option, and theorem-local action finiteness suffice for
  the welfare identity, existence of an incentivized action, and a genuine
  participation theorem.  Neither a duplicate Nash predicate nor stored
  carrier finiteness is needed.
- **Representative slice:** two actions and two outcomes, with a costless
  outside action, a costly productive action, nonnegative rewards, and a
  nonnegative outcome-contingent payment.  Remove the costless action in a
  negative control to refute automatic participation from limited liability
  and incentive compatibility alone.
- **Competing designs:** a native role-asymmetric hidden-action model; a
  deterministic one-player utility game; or reuse of the auction
  `QuasiLinear`/VCG surface.
- **Kill conditions:** the accounting and participation chain cannot be stated
  without a strategic-game wrapper; `FinDist` loses a representative theorem that PMF
  supplied; explicit outside options force duplicate normalized predicates;
  the negative control fails; or the slice needs stored `Finite`/`Fintype`,
  raw `Function.update`, public transports, placeholders, or custom axioms.
- **Observations / measurements:** the candidate imports only `FinDist`, stores
  no capabilities, and has 167 nonblank lines and 37 declarations including
  the hostile witnesses.  A fair productive action and deterministic safe
  action make the preferred action change between zero transfer and a success
  bonus.  The bonus gives productive utility `1/2`, so it accepts outside
  utility `1/4` and rejects `3/4`.  The generic maximizer theorem specializes
  to the fixture.  A singleton positive-cost negative control is
  limited-liability and trivially incentivized but rejects outside utility
  zero, machine-refuting automatic participation without an acceptable
  fallback.
- **Trust / outcome:** the focused artifact builds warning-free.  Source scans
  find no raw update, transport, stored-finiteness workaround, placeholder, or
  custom axiom.  The welfare identity, maximizer existence, participation
  theorem, and negative control each print exactly `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.  No kill condition fired; D32 adopts a
  native opt-in `Mechanism` leaf and keeps any strategic/Bayesian or executable
  contract search behind separate consumer gates.
- **Promotion:** `GameTheory.Mechanism.PrincipalAgent` is now public through
  the opt-in Mechanism root, with independent action/outcome universes and no
  outcome-carrier finiteness.  Its 171 nonblank lines recover or strengthen
  all 23 pinned declarations; the 107-nonblank-line public fixture preserves
  stochasticity, strict contract sensitivity, nonzero reservation utilities,
  and the negative control.  The focused root/test build is warning-free, the
  full build completes 3,440 jobs, Phase 2 structural verification and exact
  coverage both return `VERIFIED=1`, and the M-CONTRACT ledger is complete
  23/23.  The integration audit caught and repaired missing reducibility
  annotations and their resulting unused-simp warnings before promotion.

### EXP-066: quasilinear direct-mechanism ownership

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-08, reserved on `b0ed24b`
- **Status:** complete; supports native ownership and decides D33
- **Decision / question:** whether the shared owner for the pinned weak
  monotonicity, affine-maximizer, and Myerson families should be a native
  capability-free quasilinear direct mechanism, the existing Groves-specific
  `Mechanism.Auction.VCGSetup`, or the outcome-generic
  `Languages.BayesianMechanism`.
- **Prediction:** independent report types, an alternative carrier,
  type-dependent valuations, an allocation rule, and payments suffice to
  state true utility, dominant-strategy incentive compatibility, and weak
  monotonicity.  Adding the two opposite IC inequalities should prove the
  allocation rule weakly monotone using only `Profile.update`, without a prior,
  stored finiteness, a new Nash predicate, or a Groves-offset field.
- **Representative slice:** at least two agents, two types, and two
  alternatives; the allocation must respond to one agent's report, truthful
  utility and one deviation must be unequal, and the generic DSIC-to-weak-
  monotonicity theorem must specialize to the fixture.  A negative control
  should refute DSIC after reversing the report-sensitive allocation or
  payments while leaving the data nonconstant.
- **Competing designs:** a native `Mechanism` quasilinear direct-mechanism
  owner; extending `VCGSetup` beyond Groves mechanisms; or specializing
  `BayesianMechanism` and recovering allocation/payment projections through
  extra certificates.
- **Kill conditions:** the thin slice needs a prior, expected utility, stored
  `Finite`/`Fintype`, a dummy strategic game, direct `Function.update`, public
  transports, or a duplicate equilibrium predicate; the native object cannot
  transparently express `VCGSetup` and the pinned affine/Myerson inputs; or the
  hostile theorem becomes vacuous because allocation, valuations, payments,
  or deviation payoffs are constant.
- **Artifacts / commands:** reserved destination
  `GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/QuasiLinearMechanismOwnership.lean`;
  focused build, source-hazard scan, axiom sampling, and comparison against
  `GameTheory/Mechanism/VCG.lean` and
  `GameTheory/Languages/BayesianMechanism.lean` before any stable promotion.
- **Observations / measurements:** the 169-nonblank-line candidate stores only
  report types, valuations, allocation, and payments.  It retains independent
  player, type, and alternative universes and stores no finiteness, prior,
  probability law, equilibrium, or Groves offset.  Its `IsDSIC` is an
  abbreviation of the compiled `BayesianMechanism.IsIncentiveCompatible`, so
  the shared owner adds no second incentive predicate.  Adding the two
  opposite canonical IC inequalities and cancelling their report-sensitive
  payments proves weak monotonicity.  `VCGSetup` embeds definitionally at true
  utility.  The hostile Boolean mechanism has two players, types, and
  alternatives; both allocation and payment respond to the first player's
  report; truthful utility falls strictly from `2` to `-1` under deviation;
  the weak-monotonicity inequality is strict; and reversing allocation while
  retaining the nonconstant payment refutes DSIC.
- **Boundary / trust:** the artifact imports only the canonical Bayesian
  mechanism and existing VCG leaves.  Source scans find no raw
  `Function.update`, user-visible transport, `Fintype.ofFinite`, probability
  projection, placeholder, custom axiom, or native reduction.  Finiteness
  appears only on the VCG consumer bridge.  `lake build
  GameTheory.Experimental.PostArchitecture.QuasiLinearMechanismOwnership`
  completes warning-free in 1,726 jobs.  The monotonicity theorem, canonical
  IC bridge, strict witness, and negative control each print exactly
  `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- **Outcome:** no kill condition fired.  D33 adopts a capability-free native
  quasilinear direct-mechanism owner under the opt-in Mechanism branch.  Its
  DSIC surface is canonical IC by transparent specialization; weak
  monotonicity is the first owned allocation certificate; VCG is a consumer,
  not the foundation.
- **Promotion:** `GameTheory.Mechanism.QuasiLinearMechanism` is available
  through the opt-in Mechanism root, and `VCGSetup.toQuasiLinearMechanism` is
  the downstream Groves bridge.  The 106-nonblank-line leaf and
  67-nonblank-line hostile test close the pinned monotonicity file 5/5.  The
  focused four-target build completes warning-free in 1,750 jobs; the full
  build completes warning-free in 3,453 jobs; Phase 2 structural and exact
  coverage audits both report `VERIFIED=1`, with 1,918 pinned declarations now
  accounted for.  Affine maximizers are the next consumer before Myerson.

### EXP-067: canonical finite fair-division ownership

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-09, reserved on `e1e5052`
- **Status:** complete; supports D34 and closes the finite-EF1 critical gap
- **Decision / question:** whether finite indivisible fair division should
  consume `Mechanism.Combinatorial.Allocation`, define a parallel raw bundle
  profile as the baseline did, or compile allocations into a strategic game.
- **Prediction:** the capability-free combinatorial allocation plus an
  additive item-valuation specialization and a separate completeness
  certificate suffice for a general finite round-robin EF1 theorem.  Raw
  bundle profiles are needed only as private recursive algorithm state; no
  second public allocation type, Nash predicate, probability law, or
  measurable cake assumption is needed.
- **Representative slice:** arbitrary nonempty `Fin n` agents and finite goods
  with nonnegative additive values, culminating in a complete canonical
  round-robin allocation and EF1.  A two-agent, three-good fixture must have
  conflicting rankings, allocate a non-singleton bundle, exhibit genuine
  envy, and discharge EF1 only after removing a positively valued good.
- **Competing designs:** reuse the existing canonical disjoint allocation and
  add fair-division predicates; reproduce the comparison design's public function-valued
  allocation and feasibility predicate; or model allocation as a strategic
  mechanism outcome before fairness can be stated.
- **Kill conditions:** the general proof essentially needs a second public
  allocation carrier; canonical allocation forces stored `Fintype` or
  `DecidableEq`; the recursive algorithm needs raw `Function.update`; EF1 can
  only be shown for two agents or vacuous valuations; the fixture cannot
  distinguish envy from EF1; or finite indivisible results import measure,
  topology, probability, Protocol, or equilibrium semantics.
- **Reserved artifacts / commands:**
  `GameTheory/Mechanism/FairDivision/Basic.lean`,
  `GameTheory/Mechanism/FairDivision/RoundRobin.lean`, and
  `GameTheory/Tests/FairDivision.lean`; focused builds, source-hazard and
  reachability probes, axiom sampling, exact M-FAIR accounting, and a full
  clean build before promotion through the opt-in Mechanism root.
- **Observations / measurements:** the combinatorial allocation first shed its
  stored `DecidableEq` capabilities and retained a clean 3,500-job build.  The
  promoted fair-division leaves have 173 and 713 nonblank lines; the 71-line
  fixture has conflicting strict rankings, a complete disjoint allocation, a
  two-good envied bundle, strict envy `8 < 7 + 3`, and a positive removal
  witness.  The general theorem works for arbitrary nonempty `Fin n` agents
  and finite goods.  Private recursion uses a local `if`-based bundle update;
  the public result is the canonical allocation plus completeness.
- **Boundary / trust:** source scans initially found nineteen `▸` transports
  and one `change` inherited from the baseline; all were rewritten rather than waived.
  Phase 2 reports zero mechanism transports, zero raw updates, four reached
  fair-division inputs, and four rejected boundaries: `FinDist`, `IsNash`,
  Protocol execution, and measurable theory.  The completeness theorem, EF1
  flagship, strict-envy negative control, and removal witness print exactly
  `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- **Outcome / promotion:** no kill condition fired.  D34 adopts
  `Mechanism.FairDivision` over `Combinatorial.Allocation`; raw recursive state
  remains private and the comparison design's public `roundRobinAux` is retired.  The focused
  root/test build is warning-free, the full build completes 3,504 jobs, and
  Phase 2 plus exact coverage both return `VERIFIED=1`.  The ledgers account
  for 67/91 M-FAIR declarations, with RoundRobin complete 27/27 and the next
  breadth gates named explicitly.

### EXP-068: native ordinal stable-matching ownership

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-09, reserved on `98288d9`
- **Status:** complete; supports D35 and closes the stable-matching critical gap
- **Decision / question:** whether one-to-one matching should be a native
  `Cooperative` branch over the probability-free `Ranking` vocabulary, retain
  the comparison design's integer-score market, or compile matching into artificial strategic
  profiles and Nash equilibrium.
- **Prediction:** two rankings over optional partners, an unbundled matching
  function with a named injectivity predicate, and theorem-local finite linear
  ranking certificates suffice for deferred-acceptance stability and balanced
  perfectness.  The semantic market should store neither a cardinal utility
  scale nor finiteness, decidability, probability, or game structure.
- **Representative slice:** general finite Gale--Shapley existence followed by
  perfectness in balanced, completely acceptable markets.  A three-by-three
  fixture must force a rejection and partner replacement, expose a concrete
  blocking pair for an unstable matching, and prove that the produced stable
  matching is perfect; aligned or singleton preferences do not count.
- **Competing designs:** native ordinal rankings with `none` as an explicit
  outside option; the comparison design's integer scores plus separate reservation values; or a
  `GameForm` encoding whose equilibrium is interpreted as a matching.
- **Kill conditions:** deferred acceptance needs a stored finite carrier or a
  second preference representation; the public surface exposes raw function
  updates or equality transports; stability requires dummy strategic players,
  probability, Protocol, or Analysis; the general theorem only handles a
  concrete cardinal score; or the fixture cannot distinguish stability,
  perfectness, and an actual rejection path.
- **Reserved artifacts / commands:** `GameTheory/Cooperative/Matching.lean`,
  `GameTheory/Cooperative/GaleShapley.lean`,
  `GameTheory/Cooperative/GaleShapley/Perfect.lean`, and
  `GameTheory/Tests/Matching.lean`; focused builds, source and reachability
  audits, axiom sampling, an exact bounded P-MATCH ledger, and a full clean
  build before promotion through the opt-in `GameTheory.Cooperative` root.
- **Observations / measurements:** the promoted Matching, Gale--Shapley, and
  Perfect leaves have 129, 514, and 177 nonblank lines; the hostile test has
  269.  A game-independent 61-line `Core.Rank` addition supplies finite best
  elements and strict/weak composition directly from relation laws.  The
  three-by-three fixture proves its named successor is exactly the first
  rejection round, then proves right one replaces left two with left zero.
  A separate assignment exposes `(left one, right zero)` as a blocking pair.
  General finite deferred acceptance is stable, and balanced complete
  acceptability makes every stable matching perfect.
- **Boundary / trust:** source checks report zero cooperative transports, raw
  updates, `Fintype.ofFinite`, placeholders, native reduction, or custom
  axioms.  The Cooperative root reaches five semantic/algorithmic inputs and
  rejects Nash, `FinDist`, Protocol execution, and measurable theory.  The
  finite-best lemma, stable-existence theorem, perfectness theorem, and hostile
  specialization print exactly `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and
  `Quot.sound`.  The full 3,509-job build is warning-clean; Phase 1, corrected
  Phase 2, corrected Phase 3, and exact coverage all return `VERIFIED=1`.
- **Audit lesson / cost:** the gate found an older reachability probe naming
  `FinDistConvergesPointwise` in the wrong namespace.  It was repaired to
  probe the real analytic declaration, restoring a genuine 3/3 positive
  sequential-bridge result while retaining the negative boundaries.  The
  strengthened Phase 2 suite took 693 seconds and Phase 3 took 178 seconds,
  still within CI's release envelope but worth later harness optimization.
- **Outcome / promotion:** no kill condition fired.  D35 adopts the native
  ordinal owner and promotes the opt-in `GameTheory.Cooperative` root.  The
  P-MATCH ledger classifies all 74 bounded declarations: stable existence and
  perfectness are complete, while 11 proposer-optimality, receiver-pessimal,
  and symmetry declarations remain explicit BFS work.  The capability matrix
  moves stable matching from critical gap to better; bargaining is the next
  critical-gap rotation.

### EXP-069: topology-free bargaining ownership

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-09, reserved on `d2156f3`
- **Status:** complete; supports capability-free native ownership (D36)
- **Decision / question:** whether finite-player bargaining primitives and
  positive-affine invariance belong directly in the native `Cooperative`
  branch, require an `Analysis` feasible-set owner, or should be phrased as a
  specialization of strategic equilibrium.
- **Prediction:** an arbitrary feasible predicate on utility profiles and an
  explicit feasible disagreement point suffice for individual rationality,
  Pareto notions, Nash-product maximality, positive-affine images, and the
  flagship invariance theorem.  Convexity, compactness, logarithms, existence,
  probability, and game structure should be absent until a theorem needs them.
- **Representative slice:** two players with disagreement zero and a genuinely
  nonconstant finite feasible set containing gain profiles `(2,2)`, `(3,1)`,
  and `(1,3)`.  Prove `(2,2)` is the Nash solution, then apply unequal positive
  scales and nonzero shifts and verify the transformed maximizer.  Include a
  feasible non-solution whose Nash product is strictly smaller.
- **Competing designs:** a capability-free `Cooperative.BargainingProblem`;
  an analytic structure storing convexity/compactness; or a utility game plus
  equilibrium wrapper.
- **Kill conditions:** affine invariance needs topology, logarithms, a stored
  finite player carrier, probability, or strategic profiles; the feasible set
  must be bundled with avoidable convexity/compactness; the transformation
  duplicates an existing general affine API; public proofs require raw updates
  or transports; or the fixture is singleton/constant and cannot distinguish
  a maximizer from a feasible non-solution.
- **Reserved artifacts / commands:**
  `GameTheory/Cooperative/Bargaining.lean` and
  `GameTheory/Tests/Bargaining.lean`; focused root/test builds, Cooperative
  source and reachability audits, exact 30-row P-BARG accounting, axiom
  sampling, and a full clean build before promotion.
- **Observations / measurements:** the general weak-Pareto, symmetry, and
  affine-invariance proofs use finite-product ordered-field algebra only.  The
  semantic record stores no capability; `[Fintype Player]` occurs only on the
  Nash-product predicate and its consumers.  The fixture proves products four
  versus three, refutes an asymmetric feasible IR point as a solution, and
  maps the balanced solution to `(9,5)` with disagreement `(5,-1)`.  All 30
  pinned declarations are reviewed: the 14-row Nash slice is promoted and 16
  egalitarian/Kalai--Smorodinsky rows are explicit BFS.  Phase 2 reports
  `TRANSPORT_COOPERATIVE_SOURCE=0`, `BARGAINING_INPUT_PROBES_REACHED=3`,
  `BARGAINING_BOUNDARY_PROBES_REJECTED=4`, and
  `BUILD_OUTPUT_COMMANDS=0`; the cached, fail-fast audit completes in 405 s
  with `VERIFIED=1`.  Exact coverage reports 56 ledgers, 2,250 accounted rows,
  6,074 unaccounted, and `VERIFIED=1`.  The full warning-clean 3,511-job build
  emits no declaration-generated output.  Sampled generic and fixture
  flagships depend only on `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- **Outcome / next action:** adopt the native `Cooperative.BargainingProblem`
  owner in D36 and close bargaining as a critical capability gap.  Preserve
  topology-dependent existence for a later one-way Analysis bridge and rotate
  DFS to L-ROUND; recover egalitarian and Kalai--Smorodinsky as bounded BFS.

### EXP-070: multi-round imperfect-monitoring ownership

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-09, reserved on `e0a1471`
- **Status:** complete; supports canonical Protocol/FOSG ownership (D37)
- **Decision / question:** whether the mature previous-action and imperfect-
  monitoring workflow needs a second multi-round evaluator, can be expressed
  only as ad hoc FOSG data, or merits a thin finite-monitoring constructor that
  compiles directly to the accepted Protocol/FOSG semantics.
- **Prediction:** a finite-horizon monitoring game can own only action carriers,
  initial signals, and a finite-support signal law conditional on prior joint
  actions.  Its execution state records realized joint actions and hidden
  signals, while each Protocol information state records exactly the player's
  own prior choices and received public/private signals.  The canonical FOSG
  runner and compiler then supply all evaluation; no second history, policy,
  probability, or equilibrium layer is needed.
- **Representative slice:** a two-player, two-round game with at least three
  actions.  Construct two reachable first-round histories with the same own
  action and coarse signal but different opponent actions, and prove they give
  the player equal information despite distinct hidden execution states.
  Construct a third history with a different own action and prove the local
  information differs.  A second-round policy must branch on the remembered
  own action, and the canonical compiled run must preserve that branch.
- **Competing designs:** revive the comparison design's `Round.eval`/`evalRounds` plus compiler;
  use raw `FOSG.Game` at every call site; or add a thin
  `Languages.MultiRound.MonitoringGame` constructor whose target is the
  existing execution/information pair.
- **Kill conditions:** the constructor needs a duplicate runner or policy
  type; policies can inspect hidden opponent actions/state; own previous action
  is lost; coarse monitoring cannot merge distinct hidden histories; the base
  record stores avoidable `Fintype`, decidable equality, utility, equilibrium,
  topology, or an infinite-path law; or source-level updates/transports are
  required in the public surface.
- **Reserved artifacts / commands:**
  `GameTheory/Languages/MultiRound/Monitoring.lean`,
  `GameTheory/Languages/MultiRound.lean`, and a hostile test under
  `GameTheory/Tests/`; focused root/test build, L-ROUND source/reachability
  checks, bounded exact ledger, clean full build, and coverage audit before
  promotion.
- **Observations / measurements:** the native record stores no capability,
  utility, solution concept, or alternate evaluator.  Hidden state contains
  full realized joint actions and signals; local information contains only the
  player's own prior choices and received signals.  The general constructor
  proves canonical perfect recall.  In the hostile fixture, opponent actions
  one and two produce distinct hidden histories but equal information for a
  player that chose zero under the same coarse disagreement signal; changing
  that player's own choice changes its information and its next policy action.
  The canonical `jointAt` and `toGameForm` paths preserve this branch.  All
  233 pinned declarations are classified: 27 adapted to canonical owners, 6
  exact repeated-game theorem chains subsumed, 163 duplicate evaluator or
  serialization declarations retired, and 37 absent-minded, finite-information
  Kuhn, or generic stagewise-Nash declarations deferred.  Focused root/test
  and relocated Transfer builds are warning-clean; Phase 3 source checks
  report zero transports, raw updates, placeholders, and custom axioms.  Five
  native/Protocol inputs are positively reached, while Nash, Analysis
  consistency, Stochastic, and Repeated boundaries are rejected 4/4; the full
  hardened Phase 3 suite returns `VERIFIED=1` in 207 seconds.  Perfect recall,
  menu adequacy, hidden-opponent locality, and canonical-play samples use only
  `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.  Phase 2 source checks and
  exact coverage also return `VERIFIED=1`; the warning-clean default build
  emits only its success line for 3,514 jobs.
- **Outcome / next action:** adopt D37 and promote the opt-in multi-round root.
  The original two-round architecture witness moves to Experimental, leaving
  one real public surface.  Close the last critical capability gap by rotating
  DFS to equilibrium refinements; retain the three named L-ROUND queues for
  BFS after the release-blocking gate.

### EXP-071: trembling-hand refinement boundary

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-09, reserved on `c201670`
- **Status:** complete; supports D38 and closes the last critical capability
  gap
- **Decision / question:** whether normal-form perturbation semantics belong in
  stable Core with only pointwise convergence in Analysis, or whether the whole
  trembling-hand surface must live behind the analytic boundary.
- **Prediction:** lower-bound perturbations and restricted unilateral
  equilibrium need no topology and can reuse the sole `IsEquilibrium`
  predicate through a constrained deviation scheme.  Vanishing perturbations,
  pointwise profile convergence, and trembling-hand perfection belong in a
  one-way `Analysis.TremblingHand` leaf.  A full-support mixed Nash profile
  should be perfect by scaling its own positive masses with a vanishing real
  weight and using the same profile at every perturbed game.
- **Representative slice:** prove the general full-support-Nash-to-perfect
  theorem, then specialize it to the fair Matching Pennies equilibrium.  The
  fixture is nondegenerate: both actions have positive probability and the
  underlying game has no pure Nash equilibrium.
- **Competing designs:** put every definition in Core; put every definition in
  Analysis; or split topology-free perturbation/restricted equilibrium from
  analytic convergence/perfection while reusing canonical deviations.
- **Kill conditions:** the stable layer imports topology; perturbation defines
  a parallel Nash logical shape rather than `IsEquilibrium`; representation
  details such as PMF/ENNReal leak out of `FinDist`; the proof needs raw
  `Function.update` or source transports; full-support Nash does not provide a
  valid positive vanishing perturbation certificate; or the fixture is pure,
  singleton, or otherwise fails to exercise genuine mixing.
- **Reserved artifacts / commands:** `GameTheory/Core/TremblingHand.lean`,
  `GameTheory/Analysis/TremblingHand.lean`, and an Analysis-local focused
  Matching Pennies test;
  26-row pinned ledger, Core/Analysis reachability checks, trust sample, exact
  coverage, and warning-clean default build before promotion.
- **Observations / measurements:** Core needs only real lower bounds on
  canonical `FinDist` masses and a constrained deviation scheme mapping into
  `unilateralConstant`; `IsPerturbedEq` is therefore one specialization of
  `IsEquilibrium`, not a new Nash predicate.  Analysis alone imports
  convergence, defines vanishing perturbations, and proves that every
  full-support mixed Nash profile is trembling-hand perfect by scaling its own
  masses with `1 / (n + 2)`.  Fair Matching Pennies supplies the hostile
  witness: its two actions both have positive probability, the fair profile is
  perfect, and the underlying game has no pure Nash equilibrium.  An initial
  test location under `GameTheory/Tests` correctly failed the one-way Analysis
  source check; moving the fixture under `GameTheory/Analysis` restored zero
  outside-root importers without an exemption.  All 26 pinned declarations are
  classified: the 20-row perturbation/perfection spine is promoted and six
  distinct alternative-limit predicates remain a named BFS gate.  Focused
  Core/Analysis/test builds are warning-clean.  Phase 2 source checks report
  zero forbidden imports, representation leaks, raw updates, source
  transports, placeholders, custom axioms, and build-output commands.  The
  perturbation characterization, general perfection theorem, and hostile
  Matching Pennies result depend only on `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and
  `Quot.sound`.  The full Phase 2 gate returns `VERIFIED=1`: Core reaches its
  three intended inputs and rejects both analytic names; Analysis reaches all
  five intended inputs and rejects four unrelated domain boundaries.  Exact
  coverage returns `VERIFIED=1` at 58 ledgers and 2,509/8,324 claimed rows.
  The warning-clean default build completes all 3,517 jobs.
- **Outcome / next action:** adopt D38 and promote the split Core/Analysis
  surface.  The capability matrix now has no critical gaps, so leave DFS and
  begin breadth-first release audit and recovery across the nine partial
  mature workflows; do not treat the six deferred limit predicates as already
  recovered.

### EXP-072: general-sum discounted stochastic equilibrium boundary

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-09, reserved on `5255fc0`
- **Status:** complete; supports D39
- **Decision / question:** whether the sibling repository's finite
  general-sum Fink theorem can enter through the existing one-way
  `Analysis.Stochastic` boundary over the canonical stochastic game,
  probability, and equilibrium owners, without importing its legacy carrier
  hierarchy or broad stochastic umbrella.
- **Prediction:** a stationary Bellman certificate and its existence theorem
  should need only the current capability-light `Stochastic.Game`, `FinDist`,
  finite mixed actions, and the adopted analytic fixed-point root.  Discount
  data should remain theorem-local.  Infinite-play measures and uniform
  equilibrium existence should not be prerequisites.
- **Representative slice:** a finite two-state, two-action-per-player
  general-sum game with genuinely stochastic transitions.  The endpoint must
  produce a stationary mixed profile and continuation values satisfying both
  the normalized Bellman equalities and every unilateral one-step inequality;
  a concrete fixture must exercise both states and non-point-mass transition
  laws.
- **Competing designs:** adapt the Fink proof to the current semantic owners;
  extract or import the sibling closure; retain general-sum discounted
  existence as Frontier work; or take only the independent uniform-payoff
  perturbation lemmas while deferring Fink.
- **Kill conditions:** the proof requires storing discount, finiteness, or
  topology in the base game; requires `PMF`, infinite-path measure theory, a
  parallel probability/equilibrium/fixed-point stack, raw `Function.update`,
  or user-visible transports; broadens stable imports beyond the one-way
  Analysis root; depends on the sibling's Lean 4.32.0 toolchain behavior; or
  the only practical port is the entire legacy stochastic carrier closure.
- **Artifacts / observations:** the sibling theorem is a 1,443-line proof over
  four legacy roots.  The successor proof uses the existing product of
  standard simplices, ordinary mixed `UtilityGame` payoffs, and one new
  game-independent positive-part lemma.  The hostile two-state game has
  non-zero-sum state utilities and action-dependent transition laws whose
  support contains both states.  No kill condition fired, and the stable
  stochastic carrier was unchanged.
- **Validation:**
  `lake build GameTheory.Analysis.Stochastic.Fink
  GameTheory.Analysis.Stochastic.Examples GameTheory.Analysis.Stochastic`
  completed 3,115 jobs warning-free.  Headline axioms are exactly `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.  The full Phase 2 audit returned
  `VERIFIED=1`: stable Stochastic reached 7 inputs and rejected 4 analytic or
  unrelated names; Analysis.Stochastic reached 11 intended inputs and rejected
  both Protocol and Repeated.  Source hazards, forbidden imports, and extra
  fixed-point importers were all zero.  Exact coverage remained green; this is
  a additional capability rather than a bootstrap declaration claim.  The
  warning-clean default build completed all 3,525 jobs.
- **Outcome / next action:** adopt D39 and promote the general-sum stationary
  Bellman theorem through the one-way Analysis root.  Keep arbitrary
  history-dependent optimality and uniform-equilibrium existence behind their
  separate infinite-play and vanishing-discount gates; resume breadth-first
  mature-field recovery after this stable milestone.

### EXP-073: mixed versus pure rationalizability ownership

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-09, reserved on `18e947b`
- **Status:** complete; implementation evidence retained, terminology
  conclusion corrected by EXP-076
- **Decision / question:** whether standard Bernheim--Pearce rationalizability
  (iterated elimination by mixed dominators) can use canonical `FinDist`,
  randomized unilateral deviations, and `GameForm` directly while the D10
  executable frontend remains an explicitly pure-elimination checker.
- **Prediction:** Core can own both notions without another response,
  equilibrium, or probability layer: unqualified `IsRationalizable` denotes
  mixed elimination, the weaker notion is named `IsPureRationalizable`, and
  D10's algorithm/correctness names say `pure`.  No stored finiteness is needed
  in proof semantics.
- **Representative slice:** rename the existing pure survivor semantics and
  executable certificate, add mixed survivor semantics, prove Nash survival,
  and build a finite three-action witness whose third action is strictly
  dominated by a half/half mixture but by no pure action.
- **Competing designs:** retain pure elimination as the only selected notion;
  promote standard mixed elimination and rename the pure surface; add an exact
  rational mixed-elimination algorithm now; or defer the standard notion while
  merely documenting the mismatch.
- **Kill conditions:** the mixed definition needs `PMF`, measurable or
  infinite-support probability, Analysis, stored `Fintype`, raw
  `Function.update`, a second profile/equilibrium API, or cannot separate mixed
  from pure survival on a small nonvacuous game.  Any break in the D10
  proof/execution boundary also kills the proposed promotion.
- **Artifacts / observations:** `GameTheory.Core.Rationalizability` reuses the
  canonical randomized-deviation scheme and `FinDist`; the pure semantics and
  D10 algorithm are renamed without aliases.  No finiteness is stored in Core.
  The hostile three-action game separates the notions: action two pays `3/4`
  everywhere, no pure action dominates it, and the half/half mixture of actions
  zero and one pays `1` everywhere.  It survives pure round one (including the
  executable certificate) and fails mixed round one.  The focused
  Core/Finite/test build completed 1,754 jobs warning-free.  Representative
  mixed, pure, Nash, dominance, and executable-certificate facts depend only
  on `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.  The full Phase 2 audit
  returned `VERIFIED=1`, reaching all six intended rationalizability inputs and
  rejecting all three finite/Protocol/Analysis boundaries.  Exact coverage
  returned `VERIFIED=1` at 65 ledgers and 2,623/8,324 claimed rows.  The
  warning-clean default build completed all 3,531 jobs.  No kill condition
  fired.
- **Outcome / next action:** the implementation and hostile separation remain
  valid.  EXP-076 corrects the public interpretation: the joint-opponent
  mixed-dominator iteration is correlated rationalizability, not the
  Bernheim--Pearce independent-belief notion. A subsequent terminology audit
  also renamed the pure predicate to `SurvivesAllPureEliminationRounds`; the
  original prediction above is retained as the experiment's historical claim.

### EXP-074: finite-law VNM representation waist

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-09, reserved on `b223ee7`
- **Status:** complete; supports D41
- **Decision / question:** D2/D4 and the S-FOUND breadth-first gate; whether
  finite-outcome von Neumann--Morgenstern representation can be recovered over
  the public `FinDist` API without exposing its PMF representation, adding a
  second lottery/preference carrier, or crossing into Analysis.
- **Prediction:** expected-utility soundness, mixture independence, and
  continuity should be direct finite-expectation algebra.  The converse should
  remain topology-free if binary independence can be lifted to arbitrary
  finite compound-lottery substitution by a support-decreasing `FinDist`
  argument.  Outcome finiteness stays theorem-local.
- **Representative slice:** prove or refute the compound-substitution step for
  arbitrary finite-support outer laws, including zero-mass branches.  A
  three-outcome expected-utility order must satisfy the axioms with a genuine
  half/half certainty equivalent, while a lexicographic three-outcome order
  must exhibit the missing-continuity obstruction.
- **Competing designs:** public-`FinDist` support induction and binary
  decomposition; promote only the one-way representation-implies-axioms
  package; expose a reusable finite-law decomposition theorem only if another
  consumer justifies it; or use PMF/simplex/Analysis internals.
- **Kill conditions:** any proof needs `toPMF`, `PMF`, `ENNReal`, measurable or
  topological probability, `stdSimplex`, stored finiteness, `Fintype.ofFinite`,
  a second law/preference abstraction, or public decomposition machinery with
  no independent consumer.  Failure to handle zero branch mass or to decrease
  support honestly also kills the full-converse promotion.
- **Artifacts / observations:** the first draft allowed `0 ≤ t`; at `t = 0`
  both mixtures collapse to the common law, so reflexivity would force every
  comparison.  The experiment rejects that formulation and uses the pinned
  strict-positive condition.  The corrected spike proves an exact mixture of
  one supported point and the law conditioned on its complement, strict
  support decrease, and arbitrary finite compound substitution.  It uses no
  authored `PMF`, `toPMF`, `ENNReal`, `toReal`, `Fintype.ofFinite`, or Analysis.
  `GameTheory.Core.VNM` then completes the finite-outcome converse, including
  the degenerate and empty-outcome cases.  The hostile tests cover three
  distinct EU levels, an interior certainty equivalent, two agents, empty
  outcomes, the zero-weight regression, and a total/transitive/independent but
  noncontinuous lexicographic order.  Focused builds and the 3,542-job default
  build are warning-free.  Exact coverage returns `VERIFIED=1` at 70 ledgers
  and 2,747/8,324 claimed rows; the full structural audit returns `VERIFIED=1`
  with VNM 8/8 reached and 6/6 rejected, affine mathematics 4/4 and 2/2.
- **Outcome / next action:** adopt D41 and keep compound substitution,
  standard lotteries, and certainty equivalents private.  The complete
  66-row Basic ledger advances S-FOUND but does not complete the broader
  family; axiom independence, convergence, and selected strategic-equivalence
  results remain later breadth-first packages.

### EXP-075: imperfect-information subgame semantics

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-09, reserved on `ac42e67`
- **Status:** complete; supports D42
- **Decision / question:** whether the predicate currently called
  `IsSubgamePerfect`, which compares whole replacement policies after every
  complete history, is textbook subgame perfection for imperfect-information
  protocols.
- **Prediction:** it is strictly stronger.  The historywise predicate and its
  one-shot equivalence remain valuable under an honest name; textbook SPE
  should quantify only over histories whose continuation is closed under every
  decision information set.
- **Representative slice:** two indistinguishable decision histories reached
  through different chance outcomes, with a candidate continuation rooted at
  exactly one of them.  The closure predicate must reject that root while the
  initial history remains a subgame root.
- **Competing designs:** retain the current name; restrict SPE to perfect
  information; or define information-set-closed subgame roots at Protocol and
  keep historywise optimality as a separate stronger notion.
- **Kill conditions:** the closure predicate needs EFG syntax, a second
  evaluator, user-visible transport, or cannot distinguish the crossed
  information-set root from the initial root.
- **Artifacts / observations:** the canonical closure predicate needs only
  `HistoryReaches`, activity, terminality, and equality of `infoOf`.  The
  initial history is always a root.  In the existing hidden-card protocol, the
  high-deal history is not: its continuation contains the high node of the
  blind seat's decision information set but not the indistinguishable low
  node.  `IsHistorywiseOptimal` retains the established one-shot equivalence
  and implies the new root-restricted `IsSubgamePerfect`.  Strong perfect
  information makes every history a root, so Zermelo existence remains an SPE
  theorem.  No kill condition fired.
- **Validation:** `lake build GameTheory.Protocol.SubgamePerfect
  GameTheory.Protocol.Zermelo GameTheory.Languages.EFG.SubgamePerfect
  GameTheory.Languages.EFG.Zermelo GameTheory.Tests.SubgameRoots
  GameTheory.Tests.SubgamePerfect GameTheory.Tests.EFGSubgamePerfect
  GameTheory.Tests.EFGZermelo` completed warning-free.
- **Outcome / next action:** adopt D42.  Reserve the SPE name for proper
  information-set-closed subgames, retain the stronger theorem under the
  historywise name, and report the general imperfect-information one-shot iff
  SPE theorem as open rather than inferred.

### EXP-076: correlated versus independent rationalizability terminology

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-10
- **Status:** complete; corrects D40 terminology
- **Decision / question:** whether the mixed-dominator survivor iteration from
  EXP-073 is the independent rationalizability of Bernheim and Pearce or the
  correlated-belief variant distinguished in later primary literature.
- **Prediction:** because the dominance comparison quantifies over joint
  opponents' profiles without a product-belief restriction, the correct
  public qualifier is `correlated`; an unqualified name would be ambiguous in
  games with three or more players.
- **Representative slice:** compare the Lean quantifiers with Bernheim's
  no-correlation premise and Brandenburger--Dekel's definitions of correlated
  and independent best-reply sets; then rename every stable direct consumer
  without aliases.
- **Competing designs:** retain the unqualified Bernheim--Pearce label; rename
  the existing operator correlated and defer the independent operator; or add
  an untested product-distribution surface in the corrective change.
- **Kill conditions:** the Lean operator already factors beliefs by opponent;
  the primary definitions do not distinguish the concepts beyond two-player
  games; or the rename cannot be made without compatibility aliases.
- **Artifacts / observations:** `correlatedSurvivors` permits every surviving
  joint opponents' profile in the mixed-dominance comparison.  Brandenburger
  and Dekel explicitly identify independent rationalizability with product
  beliefs and correlated rationalizability with unrestricted joint beliefs,
  and give a strict three-player separation.  Bernheim explicitly assumes no
  correlation while noting that it can be relaxed.  No kill condition fired.
- **Validation:** `lake build GameTheory.Core.Rationalizability
  GameTheory.Tests.Rationalizability GameTheory.Examples.Classic` completed
  1,757 jobs warning-free.  Source search finds no remaining stable
  `IsRationalizable` or `survivors` declaration.
- **Outcome / next action:** correct D40 and the architecture/capability
  records.  Keep independent rationalizability as an explicit delivery seam
  requiring a product-belief representation and a hostile three-player test.

### EXP-077: finite-horizon one-shot depth and Bayes fibers

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-10, reserved on `e5548ae`
- **Status:** complete; narrows the D6/D12 sequential contracts
- **Decision / question:** D6/D12; whether finite-horizon one-shot optimality
  may quantify the continuation budget independently of history depth, and
  whether normalized history reach mass is Bayes conditioning without an
  antichain premise on the information fiber.
- **Prediction:** both public contracts need narrowing.  One-shot optimality
  should compare deviations only at histories whose depth plus remaining fuel
  is the compiled horizon.  Bayes consistency should request the exact
  decision-fiber antichain property, with perfect recall proved sufficient.
- **Representative slice:** the chance-rooted stopping game in
  `Tests.EFGZermelo`, where the first decision can exit for `5` or continue to
  a second decision, together with the hidden-state EFG assessment fiber.
- **Competing designs:** retain the stronger truncated-payoff predicate;
  couple history depth to the remaining horizon; require truncation-consistent
  payoff.  For beliefs, document occupancy frequencies under the Bayes name;
  require perfect recall directly; or require the minimal antichain property
  and derive it from perfect recall.
- **Kill conditions:** the depth-coupled predicate cannot still prove the
  finite-horizon whole-policy/Nash bridge; the hostile stopping profile remains
  uninhabited; the antichain property needs language syntax or stored recall;
  or the correction introduces a second runner, belief carrier, or equilibrium
  predicate.
- **Evidence:** `IsOneShotOptimalWithin` now requires
  `trace.length + fuel + 1 = horizon`; the whole-policy induction carries the
  matching `trace.length + fuel = horizon` invariant. `Tests.Assessment`
  checks the two valid decision depths, rejects both swapped fuel values, and
  proves that early exit is absorbing. `DecisionInformationAntichain` is the
  exact premise of Bayes consistency, while
  `decisionInformationAntichain_of_perfectRecall` derives it from Protocol
  recall. The hostile EFG threads that certificate through a concrete
  sequential-equilibrium witness.
- **Observation:** the depth-coupled premise still proves the arbitrary-policy
  comparison and compiled Nash theorem. The minimal Bayes premise is strictly
  below stored recall and needs no language syntax or new belief carrier. The
  occupancy-mass helper remains public under an honest non-Bayesian name.
- **Validation:** focused builds passed for `GameTheory.Protocol.Information`,
  `GameTheory.Protocol.Assessment`, `GameTheory.Tests.Assessment`,
  `GameTheory.Analysis.Protocol.Sequential`, and
  `GameTheory.Analysis.Protocol.EFGTest`; the assessment regression completed
  warning-free in 1,736 jobs.
- **Outcome / next action:** narrow D6's finite-horizon contract and D12's
  sequential-consistency premise as measured above. No kill condition fired;
  retain perfect recall as a convenient sufficient certificate, not as stored
  Bayes data.

### EXP-078: imperfect-information one-shot deviations

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-10, reserved on `9bb069e`
- **Status:** complete; refutes the proposed equivalence and corrects D42
- **Decision / question:** D42; whether textbook imperfect-information SPE is
  equivalent to the absence, in every proper subgame, of a profitable policy
  change at one information state followed by the incumbent policy.
- **Prediction:** the equivalence fails even with finite well-founded play,
  perfect recall, and no information-state revisit.  If the initial history is
  the only proper subgame, SPE is whole-policy Nash, while two information-set
  changes can be complementary even though neither is profitable alone.
- **Representative slice:** nature privately chooses a bit; one player acts at
  two successive information sets, remembers the first action but never sees
  nature's bit, and receives a strict gain only when both prescribed actions
  change.  Each noninitial history cuts an information set across nature
  branches, so the whole game is the only proper subgame.
- **Competing designs:** prove the advertised general iff; restrict the theorem
  to games where every continuation history is a proper subgame root; or retain
  whole-policy SPE and assessment-based information-local optimality as
  distinct concepts.
- **Kill conditions:** the hostile model cannot satisfy perfect recall or
  `ActsOnceWhereItMatters`; a noninitial proper subgame catches one of the two
  changes; or one single-information-state deviation is already profitable.
- **Artifacts / observations:** `GameTheory/Tests/SubgameOneShot.lean` builds a
  four-rank finite protocol with an exact own-play decoder, proves perfect
  recall and `ActsOnceWhereItMatters`, proves that the initial history is its
  only nonterminal proper-subgame root, and verifies both sides of the
  separation. The all-false incumbent defeats every replacement at one
  reachable information state, but the all-true whole policy raises initial
  continuation value from `0` to `1`, so the incumbent is not SPE. Every kill
  condition is therefore machine-refuted.
- **Validation:** `lake build GameTheory.Tests.SubgameOneShot` completed
  warning-free in 1,729 jobs.
- **Outcome / next action:** do not add a public proper-subgame one-shot
  predicate or advertise a general iff. Whole-policy comparison at
  information-set-closed roots remains the canonical SPE definition;
  historywise one-shot optimality and assessment-based local optimality retain
  their distinct, useful scopes. A future restricted theorem is admissible
  only if a consumer supplies a stronger premise that defeats this
  complementarity example.

### EXP-079: intrinsic selected-solution strategic form

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-10, working tree after `2b27132`
- **Status:** complete; supports a selected-solution strategic leaf and D43
- **Decision / question:** D4/D5/D31; whether an intrinsically solvable model
  at a fixed nature value can compile its agent-owned pure decision rules to a
  canonical `GameForm`, external configuration utility, and ordinary
  `IsNash`, without choosing a temporal execution.
- **Prediction:** the selected closed-loop configuration is already a
  deterministic outcome law. A unilateral strategy update should re-solve
  every downstream decision while retaining the same agent as the canonical
  deviation coordinate.
- **Representative slice:** a causal Boolean sender observes nature and a
  receiver observes the sender decision. At nature `true`, truthful/copying
  rules are Nash; a constant-false sender profile is not, because changing
  only the sender rule changes both selected decisions and raises payoff.
- **Competing designs:** direct selected-solution `GameForm`; temporal Protocol
  compilation first; or a new intrinsic-specific utility/equilibrium layer.
- **Kill conditions:** the hostile deviation cannot expose the downstream
  fixed-point effect; compilation needs stored finiteness or probability;
  utility must enter `Model`; or the proof needs a second equilibrium
  predicate, temporal runner, public transport plumbing, or trust hazard.
- **Evidence / observation:** the 164-nonblank-line spike has 17 declarations
  and imports only the stable Intrinsic example/solution leaves and
  `Core.Utility`. The causal signaling model is uniquely solvable. Updating
  only the sender's rule changes both selected decisions from false to true;
  the shared payoff rises from zero to one, so canonical `IsNash` rejects the
  control while accepting truthful/copying rules. The compiler stores no
  capability and introduces no runner, probability field, utility field,
  equilibrium predicate, transport, or trust hazard.
- **Validation:** `lake build
  GameTheory.Experimental.PostArchitecture.IntrinsicStrategic` completed
  1,724 jobs warning-free; focused source-hazard search is empty after comment
  stripping.
- **Outcome / next action:** supports. D43 adopts a theorem-only strategic leaf
  at a caller-supplied nature state. Promote the compiler and hostile witness;
  keep temporal execution, nature lotteries, and behavioral/mixed strategies
  as separate gates.

### EXP-080: product-belief independent rationalizability

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-10, reserved after `ab53b29`
- **Status:** complete; supports the canonical mixed-profile product design
- **Decision / question:** D40; whether a canonical mixed-strategy profile can
  represent per-opponent independent beliefs without a new probability layer,
  and whether that surface separates from unrestricted correlated beliefs in
  a finite three-player game.
- **Prediction:** overwrite the focal marginal in an existing mixed profile by
  a pure candidate, then use `GameForm.mixed` to obtain the product outcome
  law. Iterated best response should restrict each opponent marginal's support
  to the preceding round. A two-binary-opponent fixture should admit a
  correlated diagonal belief but no product belief for one candidate action.
- **Representative slice:** one focal player has a candidate with zero payoff
  and two alternatives whose diagonal payoffs have opposite signs while both
  reward off-diagonal opponent actions. The other two players have constant
  utility. Half mass on the two diagonal profiles supports the candidate under
  correlation; independence either creates off-diagonal mass or degenerates
  at a diagonal endpoint where one alternative is strictly profitable.
- **Competing designs:** canonical mixed profiles and `FinDist.pi`; a bespoke
  dependent opponent-product type; or leave independent rationalizability
  absent and retain only correlated mixed-dominator elimination.
- **Kill conditions:** the mixed profile does not enforce a product law; the
  candidate is a best response to some product belief; the candidate fails
  correlated rationalizability; the test works with only two players; or the
  implementation requires a second probability/equilibrium abstraction,
  stored finiteness, public transport plumbing, or a trust hazard.
- **Artifacts / observations:** `IsIndependentBestResponse` overwrites the
  focal marginal and evaluates the result through `GameForm.mixed`;
  `independentSurvivors` restricts every opponent marginal's support to the
  preceding round. Pure Nash actions survive every round, and
  `IsIndependentRationalizable.isCorrelatedRationalizable` proves the expected
  inclusion by averaging a purported mixed dominator against the product
  witness. The hostile `Option Bool` player game has exactly three players.
  Its focal action `0` survives all correlated rounds, while symbolic payoff
  polynomials and probability bounds refute every product belief in independent
  round one. Thus the converse inclusion is machine-refuted.
- **Validation:** `lake build GameTheory.Tests.Rationalizability` completed
  1,756 jobs warning-free; Phase 2 and Phase 3 expected audits both report
  `VERIFIED=1`; the full build completed 3,580 jobs warning-free. The fast
  source guards report no direct updates, placeholders, custom axioms,
  transport growth, or lines over 100. Deep reachability mode was not run.
- **Outcome / next action:** supports. Complete the D40 independent surface
  without a bespoke opponent-product type or compatibility alias. Preserve the
  separate correlated, independent, and pure-elimination names; any executable
  checker remains a distinct finite-algorithm gate.

### EXP-081: canonical FOSG counterfactual reach

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-10, reserved after `cd92ec9`
- **Status:** complete; supports D44
- **Decision / question:** D44; whether counterfactual reach and
  continuation coefficients can be theorem-only functions of canonical
  `InformationModel` finite history laws, without a native FOSG history,
  runner, probability carrier, or bridge-specific equilibrium predicate.
- **Representative slice:** a simultaneous finite game in which changing the
  focal contribution changes actual reach but not counterfactual reach, plus
  a separate opponent-only change that makes counterfactual reach zero. A
  two-step imperfect-recall fixture consults one player twice at the same
  information state and checks focal reach `1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4` against
  counterfactual reach `1`.
- **Competing designs:** canonical behavioral history-law marginals with an
  explicit focal-policy substitution; a bespoke counterfactual runner; or no
  stable surface until a regret consumer fixes the required coefficient shape.
- **Kill conditions:** the proposed coefficient still varies with the focal
  player's own reach factor; loses opponent or chance mass; requires a second
  runner/carrier, stored global finiteness, public transport plumbing, or a
  definition that no continuation/regret theorem consumes.
- **Artifacts / observations:** the spike first produced a recursive actual
  trace weight, then rejected it after discovering the existing canonical
  `historyReachProbability`; the promoted API contains no duplicate actual
  reach. `behavioralJoint_prob_eq_prod` derives coordinate masses from the
  canonical product law. `runBehavioralFrom_one_prob_extend` identifies each
  selected joint/transition coefficient with the exact one-step continuation
  mass, `historyReachProbability_extend` proves the recursive continuation
  equation for the existing history law, and
  `historyReachProbability_eq_player_mul_counterfactual` factors canonical
  reach on every indexed trace. Full counterfactual reach is invariant under
  focal-policy changes. The simultaneous fixture separately falsifies loss of
  opponent mass; the two-step fixture falsifies a last-step-only alias.
- **Validation:** the narrow source/consumer build completed 1,738 jobs
  warning-free; Phase 2 and Phase 3 expected audits both report `VERIFIED=1`;
  the full build completed 3,583 jobs warning-free. The promoted source and
  consumers have no placeholders, custom axioms, raw
  updates, `Fintype.ofFinite`, `open Classical`, transport tokens, or lines
  over 100. Fast Phase 2/3 audits and full integration are recorded with the
  promotion commit; deep reachability mode is deliberately not run.
- **Outcome / next action:** supports. D44 adopts canonical Protocol history
  reach plus theorem-only focal/counterfactual factors. The coefficient package
  is delivered; it does not count as CFR. Next add a regret decomposition that
  consumes these coefficients, and only then gate a CFR convergence theorem.

### EXP-082: counterfactual regret decomposition

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-10, reserved after `c8dff38`
- **Status:** complete; supports D45
- **Decision / question:** D45; whether canonical counterfactual reach can
  support a useful deviation-gain/regret decomposition over finite Protocol
  continuations without defining a second utility, deviation, history, or
  equilibrium semantics.
- **Prediction:** a counterfactual continuation value should weight each
  canonical history in an information fiber by
  `counterfactualReachProbability`, evaluate the existing
  `runBehavioralFrom` continuation after an information-local commitment, and
  expose a theorem relating local regret to an ordinary behavioral-policy
  deviation gain. A mere definition or self-average identity is insufficient.
- **Representative slice:** nature selects one of two hidden histories in a
  shared decision information site. Matching hidden `true` pays two and
  matching `false` pays one, so pure `true` has exact regret `1/4` and pure
  `false` has exact regret `-1/4` against the fully mixed policy.
- **Competing designs:** counterfactual values over canonical histories and
  external payoff; reuse only the existing assessment continuation context;
  compile to the canonical behavioral `GameForm` and decompose its deviation
  gain; or restore native FOSG/CFR value and regret structures.
- **Kill conditions:** the theorem does not consume
  `counterfactualReachProbability`; normalized assessment beliefs erase the
  reach factor; repeated information states are silently treated as perfect
  recall; local terms do not control an ordinary canonical deviation gain; or
  the spike needs a second runner, payoff/equilibrium predicate, raw update,
  stored global finiteness, public transport, or an unconsumed regret family.
- **Artifacts / observations:** `counterfactualContinuationValue` weights the
  existing history fiber by D44 reach and evaluates the canonical behavioral
  continuation runner. `informationMass_mul_bayesGain_eq_ownReach_mul_counterfactualRegret`
  is the exact deviation-gain identity; the sign theorem consumes it.
  `counterfactualActionRegret` specializes through the existing
  transport-free pure commitment. Focal reach is proved equal to the
  probability of `ownPlay`, so perfect recall supplies the named
  `CommonPlayerReachAt` certificate; positive information mass makes its
  factor positive. The hostile fixture also consumes that weaker certificate
  directly without claiming recall.
- **Validation:** narrow source/consumer build completed 1,775 jobs and the
  stable Protocol-analysis aggregate completed 1,776 jobs warning-free. Fast
  Phase 2 and Phase 3 expected audits both report `VERIFIED=1`; the full build
  completed 3,585 jobs warning-free. The promoted source and consumer contain
  no placeholders, custom axioms, raw updates, stored `Fintype.ofFinite`,
  `open Classical`, transport tokens, or lines over 100. Deep reachability mode
  was deliberately not run.
- **Outcome / next action:** supports. Adopt D45 and promote the generic and
  action-local decompositions. This does not count as cumulative CFR or a
  convergence result. Next require a repeated update trace, an actual
  average-regret/exploitability theorem, and a discriminating failure control.

### EXP-083: local CFR regret matching

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-10, reserved after `b94c7e7`
- **Status:** complete; supports D46's local scope
- **Decision / question:** D46; whether D45's pure-action counterfactual regret
  can instantiate the existing external-regret-matching/approachability engine
  as an actual cumulative local CFR update, without a second learner, history,
  payoff, or regret-vector semantics.
- **Prediction:** define the local regret vector coordinatewise from
  `counterfactualActionRegret`; install `regretMatch`'s finite law at the
  selected information state through a transport-free behavioral-policy
  operation; and prove that the running average approaches the nonpositive
  orthant. A finite bound is preferred. The generic bridge may state the exact
  realization equation as a premise only if a hostile Protocol fixture
  discharges it for every current action law.
- **Representative slice:** reuse the two-history asymmetric-payoff site from
  EXP-082, now with an arbitrary current action law rather than only the fully
  mixed baseline. The update must favor the profitable action and the local
  regret vector must be nonconstant; a fixed losing policy supplies the
  positive-regret control.
- **Competing designs:** reuse `Analysis.Approachability.regretMatch`; introduce
  a CFR-specific regret matcher; compile the local continuation to a static
  action game; or defer all local learning until a global extensive-form
  exploitability proof is available.
- **Kill conditions:** the cumulative theorem never mentions D45 action
  regret; the realization premise merely assumes convergence; arbitrary action
  laws cannot be installed without public transport/raw update; the hostile
  fixture works only for one named distribution; or the result is described as
  global CFR/exploitability despite proving only local regret matching.
- **Artifacts / observations:** `BehavioralPolicy.withLaw` installs an
  arbitrary finite law through the existing coordinate split and proves exact
  self/other equations. `localCounterfactualRegretVector` is coordinatewise
  D45 action regret. The generic adapter assumes only its pointwise equality to
  ordinary `regretPayoff` for every current law and environment; it then reuses
  the sole regret matcher. The hidden-information fixture discharges that
  equality for every law, proves the finite bound
  `t * infDist^2 <= 4`, and consumes the asymptotic theorem. A fixed false law
  has true-action regret `1/2`, and `regretMatch` responds with probability one
  on true.
- **Validation:** narrow stable source/consumer build completed 2,448 jobs and
  the Protocol-analysis aggregate completed 2,449 jobs warning-free. Fast
  Phase 2 and Phase 3 expected audits both report `VERIFIED=1`. The full
  `GameTheory` library target completed 3,585 jobs and the Analysis umbrella
  completed 3,207 jobs warning-free. The promoted leaves contain no
  placeholders, custom axioms, raw updates, stored `Fintype.ofFinite`,
  `open Classical`, transport tokens, or lines over 100. Deep reachability mode
  was deliberately not run.
- **Outcome / next action:** supports local CFR regret matching and adopts D46.
  Do not credit global CFR or exploitability. Next prove the
  across-information-set deviation decomposition under perfect recall, then
  connect all local learners to a root-regret or two-player zero-sum average
  strategy theorem with a failed-learner control.

### EXP-084: generic local CFR realization

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-10, reserved after `62ee981`
- **Status:** complete; supports D47 with a compile-time narrowing
- **Decision / question:** D47; whether the exact realization premise left by
  D46 can be discharged once for canonical Protocol semantics when a decision
  information state is not revisited, rather than reproved by each model.
- **Prediction:** under `ActsOnceWhereItMatters` and an explicit certificate
  that the information fiber is nonterminal, continuation value is affine in
  a law installed by `BehavioralPolicy.withLaw`. Expanding that law over pure
  commitments should identify D45's local counterfactual-regret vector with
  the existing `regretPayoff`, yielding ready-to-use finite and asymptotic
  local CFR theorems. Perfect recall should discharge only the no-revisit
  premise, since Protocol intentionally does not force terminal players to be
  inactive.
- **Representative slice:** a two-stage perfect-recall decision problem with
  nonconstant downstream continuation, so the proof cannot succeed merely by
  reducing a one-step terminal payoff. The existing complementarity fixture
  also supplies a hostile control: separately harmless actual root changes can
  conceal a profitable coordinated policy change, while a sound local
  counterfactual calculation must expose the relevant downstream action.
- **Competing designs:** a generic runner-linearity theorem plus the existing
  D45/D46 APIs; a model-specific realization proof at every information site;
  a second counterfactual runner; or a stronger stored protocol well-formedness
  condition that terminal states have no active players.
- **Kill conditions:** linearity fails despite no revisit; the theorem silently
  assumes terminal inactivity; it needs global finite information carriers,
  raw update, public transport, a duplicate runner/regret semantics, or only
  works for the named fixture; or the hostile control shows the result has
  been overstated as global CFR/exploitability.
- **Artifacts / observations:** `behavioralJoint_update_withLaw_eq_bind`
  factors the current finite player product at one coordinate.
  `runBehavioralFrom_update_withLaw_eq_bind` uses the existing runner and
  `ActsOnceWhereItMatters` to preserve that mixture through arbitrary
  downstream play. `InformationSite.AllNonterminal` records the separate fact
  execution needs at every history in the fiber; `InformationSite.active` is
  derived from the information-local menu. The runner identity lifts through
  expectation and the canonical counterfactual sum to
  `counterfactualActionRegret_eq_sub_expect`. The resulting vector theorem
  identifies D45 regret with ordinary `regretPayoff` for every installed law.
  A two-decision perfect-recall consumer uses fuel two, passes the generic
  realization directly into D46 asymptotic learning, and retains the known
  harmless-one-site/profitable-two-site SPE counterexample.
- **Compile-time observation:** an expanded environment-wide convenience
  wrapper made the matching leaf elaborate beyond a 184-second timeout. Moving
  the same dependent statement to a separate adapter leaf still exceeded the
  64-second implementation-loop guard, while deleting that theorem made the
  adapter build in 13.8 seconds. The wrapper was rejected. The promoted
  fixed-environment vector theorem builds with the matching leaf in 10.6
  seconds, and the direct hostile consumer builds in 10.8 seconds.
- **Validation:** the combined old/new counterfactual consumers completed
  2,451 jobs warning-free; the stable Protocol-analysis aggregate completed
  2,446 jobs warning-free. Fast Phase 2 and Phase 3 expected audits report
  `VERIFIED=1` in 8.8 and 5.3 seconds. The full `GameTheory` target completed
  3,586 jobs warning-free. The promoted source and consumer contain no
  placeholders, custom axioms, raw updates, stored `Fintype.ofFinite`, public
  transport tokens, or lines over 100. Deep reachability mode was deliberately
  not run.
- **Outcome / next action:** supports and adopts D47, narrowed to the responsive
  fixed-environment realization seam. Qualifying perfect-recall sites no
  longer need a model-specific D46 realization proof. Do not credit global CFR
  or exploitability: next prove the across-information-set deviation
  decomposition, then connect all local learners to root regret or a
  two-player zero-sum exploitability theorem with a failed-learner control.

### EXP-085: across-information-set counterfactual decomposition

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-10, reserved after `a520a87`
- **Status:** complete; narrows D48 without adopting a global theorem
- **Decision / question:** D48; whether a whole behavioral-policy deviation in
  a finite perfect-recall Protocol admits a useful root-gain decomposition into
  D45/D47 local counterfactual regrets, weighted by the deviator's own reach
  under the alternative policy.
- **Prediction:** the standard telescoping identity must include off-path
  information sites and alternative-policy own reach. On the two-stage
  complementarity fixture, the first-site term is zero, the off-path
  second-after-true term is one, and their sum is the exact profitable root
  gain. A statement summing only baseline-reached sites must fail.
- **Representative slice:** the incumbent `false,false` policy versus the
  `true,true` alternative in `Tests/SubgameOneShot`. Existing actual one-site
  tests are all harmless, yet the whole deviation gains one. This forces a
  correct decomposition to expose the off-path second information state.
- **Competing designs:** fixed-horizon decomposition with a named common-depth
  certificate; history-indexed remaining fuel; well-founded terminal
  continuation values; or a theorem stated only for a synchronous finite EFG
  layer. The shortest hostile slice should decide which evaluator can express
  the identity without duplicating histories, runners, utilities, or regret.
- **Kill conditions:** the sum ignores off-path sites or uses baseline rather
  than alternative own reach; fixed fuel evaluates unequal-depth histories at
  incompatible times; the result requires a second runner/regret semantics,
  global finiteness stored in the model, raw update, public transport, or a
  claim of global CFR before an exact root-gain consumer exists.
- **Artifacts / observations:**
  `Analysis/Protocol/CounterfactualDecompositionTest.lean` evaluates the
  incumbent `false,false` policy and the `true,true` deviation on the canonical
  two-stage Protocol. The first-site counterfactual action regret is exactly
  zero. The off-path `second-after-true` regret is exactly one. Alternative
  own reach weights those terms by one and one, recovering the well-founded
  root gain exactly; baseline own reach gives the decisive second site weight
  zero. Thus baseline-reached-only summation is machine-refuted. The proof uses
  the same behavioral runner and D45 action regret, not a fixture-local regret
  definition.
- **Evaluator observation:** the two sites naturally use continuation fuels
  two and one. This does not by itself refute a common larger fuel: once every
  relevant continuation has terminated, Protocol absorption makes extra fuel
  observationally irrelevant. A generic theorem must therefore expose either
  a bounded-termination/absorption certificate or a remaining-horizon schedule;
  the fixture does not justify choosing between them.
- **Validation:** the hostile module completed 2,442 jobs warning-free in
  8.5 seconds, and the full library completed 3,587 jobs warning-free. Fast
  Phase 2 and Phase 3 audits report `VERIFIED=1`. A follow-up found that an
  attempted zero ratchet had mistaken the designated singleton-subprofile
  transport and the deliberately transport-bearing D1 experiment for stale
  source; the expected values remain one for each, with all other scoped
  transport counts unchanged. Source checks found no placeholders, custom
  axioms, raw updates, stored `Fintype.ofFinite`, public transport tokens,
  `open Classical`, or lines over 100. Deep reachability mode was deliberately
  not run.
- **Outcome / next action:** narrows D48. Alternative-policy own reach and an
  explicit off-path term are mandatory. Do not credit global CFR yet. Next
  prove a generic single-site root-gain identity under a responsive bounded
  evaluator contract, then telescope topologically ordered site changes and
  consume every local term in a root-regret or exploitability theorem.

### EXP-086: bounded single-site root bridge

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-10, reserved after `d2ec040`
- **Status:** complete; supports scoped adoption
- **Decision / question:** D48; whether one common-depth information-site
  replacement admits an exact root-gain identity through the canonical
  behavioral runner, using only a bounded cut and the existing D45 regret.
- **Prediction:** split the run at the site's depth, prove that a local policy
  change is invisible before the cut and outside the site afterward, then
  reindex the cut law over the canonical information-history fiber. Common
  alternative own reach should factor out and leave exactly D45
  counterfactual regret.
- **Representative slice:** first prove a generic strict-prefix runner
  congruence and common-depth local-replacement prefix law; then make the
  EXP-085 two-site fixture consume the root bridge rather than closing its
  identity by normalization alone.
- **Kill conditions:** the semantic bridge is merely assumed as a certificate;
  the proof needs a second runner, global stored finiteness, raw update, public
  transport, or an evaluator stronger than an explicit bounded cut; or the
  generic theorem cannot discharge both the on-path zero and off-path positive
  terms of EXP-085 within the responsive narrow-build budget.
- **Artifacts / observations:**
  `Analysis/Protocol/CounterfactualDecomposition.lean` proves strict-prefix
  runner congruence, common-depth prefix invariance, exact root splitting,
  cut-law reindexing through canonical history reach, past-site irrelevance,
  and the single-site identity
  `root gain = own reach * D45 counterfactual regret`. Perfect recall supplies
  the common own-reach coefficient, and a pure-action corollary targets D47.
  Early terminal branches require no equal-depth fiction: a new runner-support
  theorem proves that they are absorbed, while every nonterminal cut history
  has used the full fuel block.
- **Hostile consumer:** the first local replacement has exact zero root gain.
  After that ancestor is installed, the off-path second replacement has unit
  own reach and unit action regret. A generic finite telescope then proves the
  coordinated two-site policy has exact unit gain in the canonical three-step
  behavioral runner. Baseline reach still assigns the decisive site zero.
- **Compile-time observation:** placing both composed applications back into
  the already large hostile fixture exceeded the 30-second loop guard. Keeping
  the generic theorem in its own leaf and the composed consumers in
  `CounterfactualRootBridgeTest.lean` reduced their narrow builds to about 8
  and 9 seconds. No expanded convenience wrapper was retained.
- **Validation:** the stable decomposition leaf, hostile fixture, and composed
  root consumer build warning-free in roughly 7–9 seconds when cached; the
  Protocol-analysis aggregate completed 2,447 jobs warning-free. Fast Phase 2
  and Phase 3 audits report `VERIFIED=1`. The first full build crossed its
  60-second process guard; its exact orphaned `lake build GameTheory` tree was
  inspected and stopped, and the cached rerun completed 3,589 jobs
  warning-free in 9.8 seconds. Deep reachability mode was not run.
- **Outcome / next action:** supports D48 for bounded common-depth sites and a
  caller-supplied finite topological chain of local replacements. This is an
  exact whole-policy root decomposition, but not yet a global CFR convergence
  theorem. Next use the finite telescope plus every D46 local cumulative bound
  to control root regret, then specialize to two-player zero-sum
  exploitability with a failed-learner control.

### EXP-087: finite root-regret aggregation

- **Date / revision:** reserved 2026-08-10 after `455742b`; completed
  2026-08-11 in the following focused commit
- **Status:** complete; supports D49 for fixed finite D48 decompositions
- **Decision / question:** D49; whether the D48 root telescope and every D46
  local average-regret process yield a uniform bound on canonical behavioral
  root deviations, rather than merely a family of unrelated local limits.
- **Prediction:** a finite family of local regret vectors controls every pure
  policy deviation by the sum of their distances to the nonpositive orthants.
  The exact Cesaro identity for `avgVec` must connect instantaneous D48 terms
  to those local averages; a finite sum of the D46 limits should then drive
  positive root regret to zero.
- **Representative slice:** first prove the game-independent finite-family
  inequality, then instantiate it on the two-stage complementarity Protocol
  with all topologically relevant information sites and simultaneous local
  regret-matching state. Retain the fixed `false,false` trajectory as a
  failed-learner control with persistent unit root regret.
- **Competing designs:** an abstract finite-family aggregation theorem with a
  separate Protocol decomposition premise; a bundled finite information-site
  schedule; or a fixture-specific simultaneous CFR recursion promoted only
  after its types stabilize.
- **Kill conditions:** credit from a new root-regret definition alone; a bound
  for one local site presented as global CFR; omission of off-path sites;
  convergence assumed rather than obtained from every D46 process; a second
  runner or payoff semantics; or a consumer that never bounds a canonical
  root deviation.
- **Artifacts / observations:** `GameTheory.Math.Approachability` proves the
  exact Cesaro identity for `avgVec`; `OrthantProjection` bounds each positive
  coordinate by orthant distance; and `RegretAggregation` proves the finite
  weighted-coordinate and positive-average-gain bounds. The Protocol leaf
  names the actual D45/D46 running average and specializes the finite bound to
  an exact D48 scalar root decomposition.
- **Hostile positive consumer:** the two-stage complementarity fixture runs
  simultaneous regret matching at the first and off-path second-after-true
  sites. Each local process sees the other site's law as environment. Its
  mutually recursive state is proved equal to both actual D46 averages; D47
  discharges both realization equations; the new past-site invariance theorem
  and D48 root bridges prove the canonical per-round root gain is exactly the
  sum of their selected coordinates. With the ordinary local norm-bound
  premises, the two D46 limits and the finite root inequality give vanishing
  positive average root gain.
- **Negative control:** a law-ignoring process repeats the incumbent and the
  coordinated deviation. Its canonical positive root average is exactly one
  at every nonempty horizon. The finite inequality still sees the unit
  off-path term, but realization fails, so no convergence theorem applies.
- **Compile-time observation:** a dependent convenience wrapper applying every
  asymptotic local theorem in one elaborator call repeatedly crossed the
  30-second loop guard. It was removed. The responsive consumer invokes D46
  once per concrete site and combines the two limits through the finite bound;
  the final leaf rebuilds in about 8.4 seconds when cached.
- **Validation:** narrow stable and hostile targets build warning-free;
  `CounterfactualRootRegretTest` completes 2,447 jobs in 8.4 seconds cached.
  The promoted `GameTheory.Math` and Protocol-analysis aggregates complete
  2,463 jobs in 10.8 seconds. Fast expected Phase 2/3 audits both report
  `VERIFIED=1`, with Analysis transport still zero and no source hazards. The
  first package build crossed the 30-second process guard; its exact build tree
  was inspected and stopped, and the cached rerun completed 3,592 jobs
  warning-free in 16.8 seconds. Deep reachability mode was deliberately not
  run.
- **Outcome / next action:** adopts D49 for a fixed finite D48 decomposition.
  Do not claim full CFR or exploitability. Next enumerate a complete finite
  topological schedule, obtain a deviation-uniform bound, discharge local norm
  bounds from payoff ranges, and connect the result to canonical strategic
  external regret before the two-player zero-sum specialization.

### EXP-088: uniform finite-deviation root regret

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-11, reserved after `c7aec57`
- **Status:** complete; supports D50 for decomposition-certified finite
  deviation families
- **Decision / question:** D50; whether one finite family of D46 local
  processes controls every payoff-relevant pure policy deviation uniformly and
  reaches the canonical strategic external-regret interface.
- **Prediction:** the D49 right-hand side is independent of the selected local
  coordinates. Quantifying the D48 upper decomposition over a finite deviation
  carrier should therefore give one common root-regret bound. A fixed
  behavioral replacement in the compiled strategic form must have the same
  time-average gain as the corresponding root deviation; otherwise the result
  is not yet useful for equilibrium or exploitability.
- **Representative slice:** extend the two-stage complementarity consumer from
  the single `true,true` deviation to every payoff-relevant Boolean plan. The
  branch with a false first action must be handled as a nonprofitable control,
  not by inventing a missing local learner. Then consume Core's canonical
  external-regret/time-average theorem.
- **Competing designs:** quantify deviations over the existing finite-family
  inequality; bundle a complete topological site schedule; or expose only a
  per-deviation theorem and derive uniformity at the strategic layer.
- **Kill conditions:** a maximum over newly defined proxy utilities; a
  round-varying replacement presented as external regret; omitted pure plans;
  a bound depending on the selected deviation; convergence assumed rather
  than inherited from all local D46 processes; or a zero-sum exploitability
  label before canonical external regret is reached.
- **Planned validation:** a responsive uniform aggregation leaf, a compiled
  strategic-form consumer with positive and nonprofitable plan controls,
  narrow builds, fast expected Phase 2/3 audits, and a package gate only after
  promotion. Deep reachability remains excluded from the implementation loop.
- **Artifacts / observations:**
  `GameTheory.Math.RegretAggregation.positiveAverageGains_le_sum_infDist`
  gives every deviation the same local-distance right-hand side and accepts an
  upper decomposition, so false-first plans use zero later-site reach rather
  than a fictional learner. Its asymptotic companion derives every root limit
  from the finite family of local limits. The Protocol specialization consumes
  actual D46 averages. `regretPayoff_norm_le_card_mul_width` and
  `counterfactualActionUtility_mem_Icc` turn the hostile slice's proved
  `[0,1]` continuation certificate into both local norm bounds. The consumer
  enumerates all four payoff-relevant Boolean plans and proves that committing
  both learned coordinates is a fixed, round-independent behavioral strategy.
  Each scalar root gain is exactly `UtilityGame.externalRegret`; the compiled
  `timeAverage` external regret converges through Core's existing theorem.
  Canonical positive and nonprofitable controls are exactly `1` and `-1`.
- **Measurements:** warm narrow builds complete in about 7.2 seconds for the
  stable Protocol leaf and 9.1 seconds for the hostile consumer. The first
  cold consumer rebuild crossed the 30-second shell budget after two stable
  dependencies changed; the exact process check found no surviving Lake or
  Lean process, and the warm retry restored the normal implementation loop.
  Deep reachability was not run.
- **Outcome / next action:** adopts scoped D50. The result is useful at the
  canonical strategic interface and no longer assumes local boundedness or
  root convergence. It does not yet synthesize complete schedules for every
  Protocol, dominate arbitrary behavioral replacements, or prove
  exploitability. Next specialize both players' external-regret bounds to an
  explicit two-player zero-sum saddle gap with a nonzero control.

### EXP-089: zero-sum empirical saddle gap

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-11, reserved after `dfec280`
- **Status:** completed; supports scoped D51
- **Decision / question:** D51; whether the sum of both players' canonical
  external regrets is exactly the saddle deviation gap of their independent
  empirical marginals in a two-player zero-sum game.
- **Prediction:** zero-sum cancellation removes the correlated round payoff.
  Row regret should leave the payoff of a fixed row against the column
  marginal; column regret should leave the payoff of the row marginal against
  a fixed column. Their sum is the explicit saddle gap, and uniform bounds for
  both players should imply canonical approximate mixed Nash.
- **Representative slice:** first prove the algebra for arbitrary finite-law
  traces in a rectangular matrix game, then use a mismatched Boolean trace
  whose empirical marginals have a strictly positive checked gap. Only after
  that static theorem passes may a Protocol/CFR specialization be credited.
- **Competing designs:** an explicit gap equality plus canonical
  `IsεNash`; a new maximized exploitability definition; or a matrix-only proxy
  regret. Prefer the equality and existing equilibrium predicate if they
  suffice.
- **Kill conditions:** a second regret definition, independent marginals
  assumed rather than derived, cancellation that uses non-zero-sum payoffs, a
  gap theorem without a positive control, or a Protocol-specific proof before
  the static algebra is reusable.
- **Planned validation:** one responsive stable Analysis leaf, a positive and
  zero-gap matrix consumer, narrow builds, fast Phase 2/3 audits, and no deep
  reachability in the implementation loop.
- **Artifacts / observations:**
  `GameTheory.MatrixGame.saddleGap_eq_externalRegret_add`
  cancels the correlated baseline payoff from the two canonical external
  regrets. Pure and mixed deviation corollaries lead directly to canonical
  `IsεNash` for the independently played empirical marginals. The theorem
  accepts an arbitrary joint trace law and derives both marginals with
  `FinDist.map`; it does not assume the trace itself is independent. The
  correlated diagonal control has signed regrets `-1` and `1` and produces an
  exact mixed Nash certificate. The mismatched pure control has row and column
  regrets `2` and `0`, and the exact saddle gap is `2`.
- **Measurements:** the stable leaf and hostile consumer each complete a warm
  build in about 6.3 seconds (1,725 and 1,726 jobs respectively); the combined
  rebuild after the final public-name polish completed in 15.4 seconds. The
  Analysis aggregator completed 3,211 jobs in 11.4 seconds, and the cached
  stable package gate completed 3,594 jobs in 3.3 seconds. Both fast audits
  reported `VERIFIED=1`. Deep reachability was not run.
- **Outcome / next action:** adopts scoped D51. The static no-regret-to-zero-sum
  equilibrium implication is now reusable and canonical, including genuinely
  correlated history laws and nonzero evidence. Next build one two-player
  zero-sum Protocol/CFR schedule whose D50 bounds share the same round law and
  consume D51; do not relabel this static gate as full CFR exploitability.

### EXP-090: same-trace two-player Protocol regret

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-11, reserved after `8f8e50f`
- **Status:** completed; supports scoped D52
- **Decision / question:** D52; whether two local Protocol regret-matching
  processes can be assembled into one actual zero-sum round law whose two D50
  bounds directly satisfy D51.
- **Prediction:** a one-shot simultaneous Protocol with separable zero-sum
  payoff lets both nontrivial players learn their strict optimal action while
  remaining an honest shared-law test. Each local counterfactual vector should
  control the corresponding canonical matrix regret of the same product round
  law; time averaging should then yield a canonical approximate-Nash profile
  with tolerance tending to zero.
- **Representative slice:** two Boolean players in the existing simultaneous
  one-shot FOSG/Protocol, payoff `row - column`, both local laws generated by
  D46 regret matching, and a common time-average law over their joint action
  draws. Check that both players contribute strictly at the initial fallback
  profile and that both learned laws actually change.
- **Competing designs:** a same-law action-level bridge from both D50
  certificates; two unrelated one-player external-regret limits; or a new
  coupled learner/state abstraction. Prefer the smallest shared-law theorem
  that reaches D51 without freezing a universal dynamics API.
- **Kill conditions:** different status-quo laws for the two players; a
  constant equilibrium trajectory; a trivial player carrier; an assumed
  external-regret bound; no direct D50 or D51 consumer; zero-only controls; or
  a second Protocol runner/regret/equilibrium definition.
- **Planned validation:** responsive leaf builds, exact first-round positive
  contributions from both players, nonconstant learned laws, canonical
  approximate Nash with vanishing tolerance, fast Phase 2/3 audits, and no
  deep reachability in the implementation loop.
- **Artifacts / observations:**
  `GameTheory.Analysis.Protocol.CounterfactualZeroSumLearningTest` reuses the
  existing simultaneous one-shot FOSG/Protocol and installs one D46 learner
  for each Boolean player. An arbitrary regret-matching fallback is made
  hostile by defining, for each player, a distinct action worth exactly one.
  The first local regret coordinate is therefore exactly `1`, both learned
  laws differ between rounds zero and one, and both canonical external regrets
  of the same product round law are exactly `1`. D51 computes the resulting
  initial saddle gap as exactly `2`. Time averaging that shared law identifies
  every canonical row and column external regret with the corresponding D50
  local gain average. Finite positive-part sums give two vanishing uniform
  bounds, and D51 produces canonical `IsεNash` for the empirical marginals with
  a tolerance whose limit is zero. The only reusable static helper added is
  affinity of separable matrix payoff, `expectedPayoff_sub`.
- **Measurements:** the hostile leaf completes a warm build in about 8.2
  seconds (2,455 jobs). The Analysis aggregate completes 3,211 jobs in about
  8.0 seconds. The fast Phase 2 and Phase 3 audits report `VERIFIED=1`; the
  Phase 2 audit also caught and eliminated ten unnecessary tactic-level
  definitional changes instead of increasing the transport budget. Deep
  reachability was not run. The stable package gate completed 3,595 jobs in
  10.5 seconds.
- **Outcome / next action:** adopts scoped D52. One actual two-player Protocol
  learning trace now supplies both sides of the reusable zero-sum
  regret-to-Nash theorem, with nonconstant dynamics and nonzero controls. This
  is not a universal coupled learner or general CFR exploitability theorem.
  Next test reusable finite Protocol schedule synthesis beyond one-shot
  single-site players before freezing any dynamics API; arbitrary behavioral
  replacements and unequal-depth information fibers remain separate.

### EXP-091: multi-site Bayesian Protocol regret schedule

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-11, reserved after `26ed504`
- **Status:** completed; supports scoped D53
- **Decision / question:** D53; whether the existing local Protocol learners
  can assemble into one useful two-player, multi-information-site zero-sum
  learning trace without introducing a generic coupled-state abstraction.
- **Prediction:** the Bayesian compiler supplies two positive-probability type
  sites per Boolean player at one common depth. For a separable zero-sum payoff,
  four local regret matchers should generate the same counterfactual vectors
  under the actual shared behavioral profile as in their local recurrences.
  Independent site laws should induce one law over complete contingent plans;
  D50 should bound every fixed-plan external regret on that law and D51 should
  yield empirical approximate Nash with vanishing tolerance.
- **Representative slice:** a common fair Boolean type observed by both
  players, Boolean actions, and payoff equal to the row player's type-local
  score minus the column player's type-local score. Each type has positive
  prior mass. At every player/type site, define a strict improving action
  relative to regret matching's arbitrary fallback and require the learned law
  to move after the first observation.
- **Competing designs:** explicit site-indexed plan-law assembly using the
  existing D46/D50 interfaces; a reusable coupled learner structure before its
  invariants are known; or direct full-plan regret matching that bypasses
  Protocol counterfactual analysis. Prefer the explicit assembly if it stays
  responsive and exposes the real scheduling equalities.
- **Kill conditions:** a payoff-irrelevant site; a zero-probability type; any
  local learner evaluated only against a fallback profile without an equality
  to its vector under the actual shared profile; unrelated player or site
  trace laws; an assumed root decomposition or regret limit; no direct D50 or
  D51 consumer; constant laws; or a duplicate runner, regret, or equilibrium
  semantics.
- **Planned validation:** first prove the four-site carrier/history facts and
  actual-profile vector equalities, then exact positive controls and complete
  plan-law regret decomposition, then D50/D51 convergence. Use only responsive
  leaf builds and fast Phase 2/3 audits; do not run deep reachability in the
  implementation loop.
- **Artifacts / observations:**
  `GameTheory.Analysis.Protocol.BayesianZeroSumLearningTest` uses a common fair
  Boolean type and matching-pennies payoff, so all four acting information
  sites have counterfactual reach exactly `1/2` and every branch remains
  payoff-relevant. One explicit four-coordinate Cesaro state drives the actual
  shared behavioral profile; each scheduled D46 average is proved equal to
  its corresponding state coordinate. The induced `FinDist.pi` laws range
  over complete legal type-contingent choices, and their pure payoff is proved
  equal to the direct Bayesian game's ex-ante expected utility. Direct
  Protocol calculations identify each local counterfactual utility with the
  appropriate prior-weighted matching-pennies response value. Consequently
  D50 controls every complete contingent deviation for both players on the
  same round law, and D51 yields canonical empirical `IsεNash` with tolerance
  tending to zero. The round-zero complete-plan saddle gap is exactly `2`.
  The original prediction that *every* arbitrary-fallback site could be given
  its own strict improving action was too strong for a genuinely interactive
  zero-sum payoff: at a matching-pennies fallback pair one player can tie while
  the other improves. The proved sharp control is that at every type at least
  one player's law moves; hence all branches are live and the joint dynamics
  are nonconstant without replacing the game by separable private scores.
- **Measurements:** the completed hostile leaf builds 2,452 jobs in about 8.7
  seconds on a warm tree. The cached Analysis aggregate builds 3,211 jobs in
  3.4 seconds and the stable package gate builds 3,596 jobs in 3.3 seconds.
  Fast Phase 2 and Phase 3 audits report `VERIFIED=1` in 8.9 and 4.6 seconds,
  respectively. Deep reachability was not run.
- **Outcome / next action:** adopts scoped D53. Same-depth multi-site Bayesian
  Protocol learning now reaches a useful strategic result over complete
  contingent plans without a new learner, runner, regret, or equilibrium
  abstraction. Do not generalize the explicit four-coordinate scheduler yet:
  the next distinct seams are reusable schedule synthesis, arbitrary
  behavioral replacements, and unequal-depth information fibers.

### EXP-092: potential-client stochastic proof interface

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-14, reserved after `bb03599`
- **Status:** completed; narrows the stochastic proof-view requirement without
  freezing a public API
- **Decision / question:** whether an unrelated caller can state and prove a
  public-history-dependent stochastic continuation or whole-policy deviation
  through the canonical Protocol execution and equilibrium stack without
  exposing Protocol's legal-choice encoding throughout the mathematical proof.
  This tests usefulness across the stochastic/process, Protocol/execution, and
  Core/equilibrium boundary; it is not a compatibility exercise for a named
  client.
- **Prediction:** a thin proof-facing view of public stochastic policies can be
  losslessly compiled to the existing perfect-monitoring Protocol model. It
  should commute with profile replacement, retain the canonical runner and
  payoff/equilibrium predicates, and let the hostile consumer reason primarily
  about actions, public histories, conditioning, and continuation payoffs.
- **Representative slice:** first prove a lossless equivalence between a
  public-history strategy `PublicHistory -> FinDist Action` and the canonical
  perfect-monitoring behavioral policy, including profile-update laws. Then
  use it in a two-player finite stochastic game where a public random transition
  makes a genuinely history-dependent second-stage splice strictly outperform
  a constant policy. Compute the exact whole-horizon payoff difference and
  discharge the result through the canonical strategic form and `IsεNash` or
  its negation. The witness must depend on the observed history; an absorbing
  zero-payoff or strategy-independent example does not count.
- **Competing designs:** use the Protocol policy and legal-choice subtype
  directly; add a thin proved-equivalent stochastic proof view compiled into
  Protocol; or, only if both fail, reconsider a second stochastic runner. The
  second runner is presumed rejected because it would duplicate execution
  truth.
- **Measurements:** record public statement, proof, and support lines; direct
  references to Protocol histories, legal-choice subtypes, `Option`, casts, or
  fallback choices in the consumer; compilation/profile-update laws needed;
  and focused build time. Separately record whether the view admits a clean
  restart/continuation statement rather than merely hiding constructors.
- **Kill conditions:** reject the proof view if it is not lossless, cannot
  commute propositionally with `Profile.update`, exposes fallback or legal-menu
  witnesses to ordinary stochastic proofs, duplicates the runner or equilibrium
  semantics, or merely relocates more bookkeeping than it removes. Reject the
  current Protocol-only surface as sufficient if the hostile consumer requires
  pervasive unfolding of legal choices or Protocol trace constructors to state
  recognizable stochastic mathematics.
- **Planned validation:** build the experimental leaf after the generic
  equivalence, then after the hostile consumer; build the narrow stochastic and
  Protocol owners if imports change. Use fast source checks only during the
  loop. Do not run deep reachability locally.
- **Artifacts / observations:**
  `Experimental.PostArchitecture.StochasticProofView` defines ordinary
  `PublicHistory -> FinDist Action` policies and proves both policy and profile
  equivalences with perfect-monitoring behavioral Protocol policies. Both round
  trips are propositional equalities, the translation commutes with
  `Profile.update`, and a named one-step theorem exposes native simultaneous
  action laws and `Game.transition` while continuing with the sole Protocol
  runner. `StochasticProofViewTest` draws a fair public bit before the second
  action. The constant profile ignores it; the unilateral replacement chooses
  opposite actions after the two possible histories. Both signals have positive
  probability. Canonical finite-average payoff is exactly `1/2` before the
  replacement and `1` after it, so the exact improvement is `1/2` and the
  original profile fails canonical zero-tolerance `IsεHorizonNash`.
  The known paper branches provide two useful controls rather than APIs to
  preserve: `paper/k-implementation` consumes v1 equilibrium, mixed,
  correlation, informational, and mechanism layers extensively, while
  `paper/strategic-proxy-voting` defines its own `IsPNE`/better-response
  vocabulary despite proving equilibrium results. The latter is a real bypass
  pattern that the usefulness gate must detect.
- **Measurements:** the generic view is 284 lines and the hostile consumer 355
  lines. Against the already-built identical v2 dependency tree, warning-clean
  elaboration takes about 9.5 and 11.5 seconds respectively. The hostile file
  contains no legal-choice subtype, `Legal`, fallback, cast, or `Eq.ndrec`
  reference. It still contains 12 `toExecution`, 12 `runBehavioral`, seven
  `canonicalJoint`, and seven `canonicalRealized` references, concentrated in
  continuation/payoff support. The final policy, payoff, exact-improvement, and
  non-Nash statements expose none of that bookkeeping, but the proof burden is
  too large to call the history/restart surface client-grade. Deep reachability
  was not run locally. The first hosted migration build compiled all Lean
  sources successfully; its later deep-audit step failed before any probe
  because the Windows workflow had not propagated Elan's `lake` shim to the
  PowerShell audit steps, an independent CI wiring defect.
- **Outcome / next action:** the policy/profile half of the prediction survives
  and the Protocol-only policy surface is rejected as unnecessarily encoded.
  The broader proof view does **not** graduate: it passes losslessness and exact
  strategic usefulness, but hits the bookkeeping kill condition for public
  continuation proofs. Do not add a second runner. Retain the artifacts as an
  experimental specification and next test a derived public-history
  projection/decomposition theorem over the canonical runner, with an explicit
  reduction target for execution-scaffolding references. Only the smallest
  invariant that survives a second topology may move into
  `Stochastic.PerfectMonitoring`.
- **Later evidence:** EXP-100 supplied that second topology and a generic
  arbitrary-horizon restart theorem.  The lossless policy/profile view therefore
  graduated as `Stochastic.PublicPolicy`; the history and restart surface is a
  separate `Stochastic.History` facade rather than an expansion of the
  foundational monitoring module.

### EXP-093: executable client transformation adequacy

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-14, reserved after `309e0e50`
- **Status:** completed; validates the existing composition surface without a
  new public abstraction
- **Decision / question:** whether a potential client can retain useful
  executable/domain-facing actions and realized traces while delegating
  strategic semantics to the canonical finite game and equilibrium stack,
  even when the bridge changes heterogeneous strategy carriers, player
  indexing, and outcomes. This is a general usefulness test, not a migration
  adapter for any known client.
- **Prediction:** the existing executable `TableGame` refinement plus the
  canonical outcome-map, strategy-relabel, and player-reindex theorems should
  compose into an exact Nash transport theorem. A caller should need only
  equivalences and proved runtime laws, not a second game form, preference, or
  equilibrium predicate.
- **Representative slice:** define a two-player executable rational table game
  with heterogeneous actions and nonconstant payoffs. Compile it to the
  canonical deterministic form, map realized profiles to a structured runtime
  trace, nontrivially relabel both action carriers, swap the players, and prove
  that executable Nash recognition is equivalent to canonical `IsNash` in the
  transformed domain vocabulary. Include a positive equilibrium, a refuted
  profile, exact realized-trace laws, and a lossy-summary counterexample showing
  why an arbitrary outcome projection cannot preserve all utility semantics.
- **Competing designs:** compose the existing canonical transformations; add a
  small named composition theorem only if the same proof plumbing repeats; or
  add a domain-specific game/equilibrium wrapper. The last design is presumed
  rejected because it would duplicate semantics rather than improve access to
  them.
- **Measurements:** record support and consumer lines; explicit casts,
  `Eq.ndrec`, tactic `change`, and manual profile transports; theorem-chain
  length; which equalities are definitional versus propositional; narrow build
  time; and whether the final public theorem mentions only the client's action,
  trace, and executable-game vocabulary plus canonical `IsNash`.
- **Kill conditions:** reject the current composition surface as client-grade
  if the exact theorem requires user-visible casts or transport modules,
  depends on unfolding representation internals at every transformation, only
  works for homogeneous actions or constant/trivial outcomes, or needs a
  duplicate form, utility, or equilibrium definition. Reject any proposed
  helper whose only evidence is this single topology or whose statement hides
  a lossy outcome map.
- **Planned validation:** reserve before implementation; build the experimental
  leaf after the executable bridge and after the complete transformation chain;
  run fast architecture source checks and `git diff --check`; do not run deep
  reachability locally.
- **Artifacts / observations:**
  `Experimental.PostArchitecture.RuntimeTransformAdequacy` defines an exact
  rational `TableGame` in which the two players use `Bool` and `Fin 3`, and both
  receive nonconstant payoffs through a structured realized runtime trace. Its
  client form maps outcomes to that trace, replaces both action types with
  distinct command structures through nonidentity equivalences, swaps player
  coordinates, and reindexes utilities with their owners. The final theorem
  proves executable `TableGame.isNash = true` equivalent to canonical `IsNash`
  on the fully transformed form. A concrete equilibrium and a concrete failed
  profile consume the theorem. The exact play law proves that the transformed
  runtime emits the original structured trace. As a negative control, the two
  profiles share the same one-bit coordination summary while player `true` has
  payoffs zero and three, proving that an attractive lossy projection cannot
  carry the utility semantics.
- **Measurements:** the leaf is 204 source lines, 167 nonblank. The strategic
  proof composes four existing equivalences: player reindexing, strategy
  relabeling, outcome/utility pullback, and executable finite-game correctness.
  It contains no `cast`, `Eq.ndrec`, tactic `change`, `Function.update`, or
  manual dependent-profile transport. The only definitional bridge is the
  deliberately shared rational trace payoff; all representation changes are
  handled propositionally by the named public theorems. Warning-clean direct
  elaboration against the identical v2 dependency artifacts takes about 9.9
  seconds on a warm tree. Fast Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 audits report
  `VERIFIED=1` in 0.3, 9.2, and 4.5 seconds. Deep reachability was not run.
- **Outcome / next action:** the prediction survives, including the
  heterogeneous and nontrivial-outcome kill conditions. The existing finite
  correctness and concrete transformation APIs are already client-grade for
  this topology; do not add a composite morphism, wrapper game, or parallel
  equilibrium vocabulary. Retain the hostile leaf as evidence. The next
  independent usefulness test should cross a probability argument not already
  shaped as a direct `FinDist` calculation, rather than retesting static
  representation transport.

### EXP-094: high-probability equilibrium certification

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-14, reserved after `15cc51b9`
- **Status:** completed; promotes a small public probability-bounds facade
- **Decision / question:** whether a client can prove a finite-probability
  tail bound that the `FinDist` API was not specifically shaped around, then
  use it across the probability, mixed-game, and approximate-equilibrium
  layers without opening the PMF representation or creating a parallel
  probability/equilibrium calculus.
- **Prediction:** the public real-valued `probOf`, `expect`, indicator,
  linearity, and monotonicity interface suffices for a Markov-style event
  bound. Combined with canonical `UtilityGame.mixedImprovement`, it should show
  that a law with small expected improvement assigns correspondingly small
  probability to profiles that fail canonical `IsεNash`.
- **Representative slice:** prove for an arbitrary finite-support law that a
  nonnegative observable whose value is at least a positive threshold on an
  event bounds that event's probability by expectation divided by threshold.
  Consume it with a law over mixed profiles: expected aggregate positive
  deviation gain at most `δ` must bound the probability of sampling a profile
  that is not `ε`-Nash by `δ / ε`. Add an exact finite witness with a genuinely
  nontrivial event and observable; a zero event or constant observable does not
  count.
- **Competing designs:** prove the inequality through the public finite-law
  algebra; bridge to Mathlib PMF/measure inequalities; or add a second finite
  sum probability presentation. Representation escape and parallel
  presentation are presumed rejected unless the public proof is materially
  worse or impossible.
- **Measurements:** record generic proof, game-consumer, and witness lines;
  `toPMF`, `PMF`, `ENNReal`, measure, support-proof, subtype, cast, and tactic
  `change` references; public foundational lemmas added; elaboration time; and
  whether the mathematical Markov decomposition remains visible in the proof.
- **Kill conditions:** reopen the opaque-boundary policy if the proof needs a
  repeated representation escape hatch or PMF-specific theorem; reject the
  current public algebra as sufficient if the theorem requires persistent
  support/subtype bookkeeping, a bespoke event-mass definition, or materially
  more machinery than the standard finite-sum argument. Reject a game bridge
  that introduces a second improvement or approximate-equilibrium predicate.
- **Planned validation:** reserve before code; build the generic inequality,
  then the mixed-equilibrium consumer and exact witness; run fast source audits
  and `git diff --check`; do not run deep reachability locally.
- **Artifacts / observations:** `GameTheory.Math.Probability.Bounds` proves the generalized
  finite-support event bound through public indicator expectation, monotonicity,
  and scalar linearity, and exposes ordinary `FinDist.markov_inequality` as the
  recognizable specialization. `Tests.ProbabilityBounds` uses a proper event
  of probability `1/4` and an observable equal to four on that event and zero
  elsewhere; expectation is one and the bound is exact. The independent
  `Experimental.PostArchitecture.ProbabilityTailAdequacy` consumers then cross
  two different domain seams. First, expected canonical mixed improvement at
  most `δ` bounds by `δ / ε` the probability of sampling a profile that fails
  canonical `IsεNash`; a one-player mixed-profile law puts positive mass on
  both an exact equilibrium and a profile with exact improvement two. Second,
  Bayes plausibility plus Markov bounds how often a posterior can assign a
  named state probability above a threshold; full revelation of a fair Boolean
  state supplies the concrete consumer.
- **Measurements:** the promoted facade is 49 source lines / 41 nonblank, its
  tight stable regression is 47 / 34, and the two-domain hostile consumer is
  196 / 162. The stable proof has seven textual support references, confined
  to the general premises and its pointwise proof; both domain consumers have
  zero support references. Authored declarations contain no `toPMF`, `PMF`,
  `ENNReal`, measure, subtype, cast, `Eq.ndrec`, or tactic `change` reference.
  Two public theorems were added in the new small facade; no existing
  foundational file grew. Warning-clean elaboration against identical v2
  dependency artifacts takes about 9.7 seconds for the facade, 9.8 for the
  stable test, and 11.0 for the cross-domain consumer on a warm tree. Fast
  Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 audits report `VERIFIED=1` in 0.2, 9.8, and 5.1
  seconds. Deep reachability was not run locally.
- **Outcome / next action:** the public finite-law algebra survives the
  representation kill condition and the standard finite-sum decomposition
  remains visible. The same smallest invariant is reused by equilibrium and
  posterior arguments, so it graduates to `GameTheory.Math.Probability.Bounds`;
  do not add a PMF escape policy, alternate finite-sum law, or probability
  hierarchy. The capability matrix now redirects clients looking for event or
  Markov bounds to that module. Continue the potential-client gate with the
  remaining history-dependent sequential surface rather than adding more
  concentration inequalities without a consumer.

### EXP-095: history-dependent sequential client adequacy

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-14, reserved after `142c1804`
- **Status:** completed; promotes deterministic history-step evaluation and
  validates the EFG historywise/SPE consumer
- **Decision / question:** whether a client who already has a typed
  perfect-recall EFG can prove a concrete, history-dependent contingent plan
  optimal after every continuation and hence subgame perfect without reopening
  execution construction or carrying legality/support proofs through the
  public mathematical statement.
- **Prediction:** the canonical historywise one-shot deviation theorem should
  reduce the strategic proof to local continuation comparisons. The existing
  history backward-value algebra may need one small terminal-payoff bound, but
  no new runner, EFG evaluator, policy type, or sequential solution predicate.
- **Representative slice:** reuse the existing two-decision, one-player
  perfect-recall EFG. Define a plan that chooses an initial vote and, at the
  second information state, conditions on the remembered first vote and
  matches it. Give terminal histories utility one exactly for matching votes.
  Prove the plan historywise optimal and therefore subgame perfect. Also define
  a plan that deliberately mismatches after one branch and prove a profitable
  continuation or failure of the relevant local optimality condition. A
  one-move game, constant payoff, or theorem with an assumed optimality premise
  does not count.
- **Competing designs:** use EFG's canonical historywise/one-shot surface;
  add a derived history-value bound or deterministic-continuation lemma if it
  is independently reusable; or define a language-local subtree evaluator and
  SPE predicate. The last design is presumed rejected as duplicate semantics.
- **Measurements:** record client definitions, support proof, and final theorem
  lines; direct references to Protocol histories, traces, legal joints,
  support witnesses, `historyBackwardValue`, and `historyStepValue`; casts,
  tactic `change`, and dependent transports; implementation definitions
  unfolded; and warm elaboration time. Separate existing fixture construction
  from new theorem-author burden.
- **Kill conditions:** reject the current EFG proof surface as client-grade if
  the proof must reconstruct the runner, expose legality/support certificates
  persistently, case-analyze trace proof objects rather than mathematical
  histories, or materially exceed a direct finite-tree induction. Reject any
  helper that merely packages this one game's computation or introduces a
  second evaluation/equilibrium truth.
- **Planned validation:** reserve before code; first prove exact incumbent
  continuation values and a chooser-independent payoff bound, then use the
  canonical one-shot/historywise/SPE chain and refuted control; build only the
  experimental leaf and any promoted narrow owner; run fast source audits and
  `git diff --check`; do not run deep reachability locally.
- **Artifacts / observations:**
  `Experimental.PostArchitecture.SequentialClientAdequacy` reuses the existing
  two-decision perfect-recall EFG and defines only client plans and payoff. The
  incumbent starts with `up` and at its second information state returns the
  remembered first vote; its two second-stage actions are proved distinct, so
  the plan is genuinely history dependent. Terminal utility is one exactly
  when the votes match. A generic terminal-payoff induction bounds every
  alternative chooser by one, exact continuation calculations give the
  incumbent value one after every nonterminal history, and the canonical EFG
  theorem yields historywise optimality and subgame perfection. The control
  starts `up` and then chooses `down`; replacing it by the matching plan after
  the first action raises continuation value from zero to one, refuting
  historywise optimality.
  The first attempted proof exposed a real API defect: rewriting a point-mass
  transition beneath `historyStepValue` had no type-correct dependent motive
  because continuation values consume support witnesses. The promoted
  `ExecutionProtocol.historyStepValue_of_step_eq_pure` constructs that witness
  internally. The older imperfect-information `Tests.SubgameOneShot` contained
  the same manual point-mass/proof-irrelevance block; replacing it with the new
  theorem supplies an independent topology and removes 27 net proof lines.
- **Measurements:** the hostile theorem-author leaf is 281 source lines / 246
  nonblank, excluding the pre-existing EFG construction. It contains 22 typed
  `History` and six `Trace` references, 19 `historyBackwardValue` and eight
  `historyStepValue` references, three canonical `Profile.update` references,
  and one implementation unfolding inside the generic terminal-bound proof.
  It contains zero `Legal` or support references, and no cast, `Eq.ndrec`,
  tactic `change`, or `Function.update`. The promoted semantic helper adds 30
  source lines to `Protocol.SubgamePerfect`; its first independent reuse makes
  `Tests.SubgameOneShot` 27 lines shorter net. Warning-clean elaboration takes
  about 12.2 seconds for the Protocol owner, 11.0 for the hostile leaf, and 13.0
  for the refactored older test against warm identical v2 dependencies. Fast
  Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 audits report `VERIFIED=1` in 0.3, 9.6, and 4.7
  seconds. Deep reachability was not run locally.
- **Outcome / next action:** the original deterministic continuation surface
  hit the dependent-rewrite kill condition; the smallest correction survives
  two different sequential topologies and therefore graduates. After that
  correction, clients can state and prove the final historywise/SPE results in
  EFG vocabulary without legality, support, transport, or a second evaluator.
  Keep the chooser-independent terminal bound experimental until a second
  topology needs it. Together with EXP-092 through EXP-094, this closes the
  bounded adversarial consumer categories; next reconcile the resulting
  evidence with the cutover checklist and require the hosted build plus deep
  audits before moving `main`.

### EXP-096: direct repeated-analysis reachability sentinels

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-14, hosted run at `15cc51b9`
- **Decision / question:** D12 maintenance; whether `Polynomial` still
  distinguishes a forbidden Analysis/fixed-point dependency from legitimate
  stable repeated-game mathematics.
- **Representative slice:** the hosted deep Phase 2 gate imported
  `GameTheory.Repeated.Basic`, `GameTheory.Repeated.Discounted`, and the public
  `GameTheory.Repeated` umbrella, probing `stdSimplex` and `Polynomial` from
  each. It expected six rejections and observed five after the monitoring-rank
  family had graduated.
- **Evidence / observations:** Basic and Discounted still have the original
  topology-free closure. The umbrella now intentionally imports
  `Repeated.MonitoringRank`, which imports Mathlib `Matrix.Rank`; that ordinary
  linear-algebra closure exposes `Polynomial` without importing
  `GameTheory.Analysis`, `FixedPointTheorems`, or repeated-analysis geometry.
  Authored-import checks remain zero. A focused three-root local probe exceeded
  a 60-second interactive bound before producing grouped output, independently
  confirming that deep reachability does not belong in the implementation
  loop.
- **Outcome / next action:** the `Polynomial` proxy is refuted for the public
  Repeated umbrella. Preserve the historical EXP-031 measurement, but enforce
  the live boundary with `stdSimplex` and the actual `kakutani_fixed_point`
  declaration at all three roots. Emit the exact root/declaration on mismatch.
  Keep fast audits local and require the amended six-probe result from hosted
  deep CI before cutover.

### EXP-097: implementation theory over canonical solution concepts

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-14, reserved after `f7c6c1b8`
- **Status:** completed; promotes the D54 weak-undominance seam
- **Decision / question:** potential-client usefulness gate; whether v2 can
  express implementation theory as a relationship between profile-observed
  transfers, canonical utility games, and an existing solution concept rather
  than rebuilding a kernel-game hub or a parallel equilibrium vocabulary.
- **Client evidence:** `paper/k-implementation` is a successful 19,379-line v1
  extension with more than 1,200 direct references across dominance,
  mixed/correlated equilibrium, informational games, LP certificates, and VCG.
  In contrast, `paper/strategic-proxy-voting` is a 15,154-line bypass that
  defines local `IsPNE` and better-response notions. These are positive and
  negative workflow evidence, not APIs to preserve.
- **Representative slice:** record a chosen strategy profile alongside the
  form's realized outcome, add a nonnegative profile-contingent transfer to
  canonical expected utility, and define target implementation through
  canonical weak-undominance. In a two-player Boolean game, a nonzero transfer
  must make one target profile the unique undominated profile with an exact
  finite budget; zero transfer must fail on a concrete surviving off-target
  profile.
- **Competing designs:** a generic profile-observation transformation plus a
  mechanism-domain implementation predicate; restrict immediately to
  deterministic NFGs; restore v1's bundled `KernelGame`; or parameterize a
  generic implementation operator by arbitrary solution-set predicates. The
  kernel hub and premature higher-order hierarchy are presumed rejected.
- **Measurements:** record definitions/theorem burden, profile transport,
  outcome/utility duplication, direct uses of canonical response semantics,
  finite/nonempty assumptions, implementation unfolding in the client, and
  narrow elaboration time. Search Mathlib before promoting general set/infimum
  facts.
- **Kill conditions:** reject the generic transformation if it cannot preserve
  strategy profiles definitionally, if ordinary payoff reasoning must expose
  paired outcomes persistently, or if it needs a second game/equilibrium truth.
  Do not promote an implementation predicate unless both the positive budget
  witness and off-target control consume a canonical solution concept. Stop at
  the experimental leaf if only this paper's restricted transfer language
  makes the abstraction useful.
- **Artifacts / observations:** the experimental transformation preserved
  strategy profiles definitionally once its outcome-only construction was made
  transparent. `GameForm.recordProfile` and
  `UtilityGame.withProfileTransfer` therefore graduated, together with the
  general Core predicates `IsWeaklyUndominated` and
  `IsWeaklyUndominatedProfile`. The stable mechanism predicate names its exact
  solution concept rather than pretending to be a universal implementation
  hierarchy. The Boolean witness proves exact budget-four singleton
  implementation, derives implementation of a non-singleton target cylinder,
  and refutes both targets under zero transfer using the concrete surviving
  all-false profile.
- **Measurements:** `Core.Form` adds 20 source lines and `Core.Response` 10.
  The mechanism facade is 93 source lines / 75 nonblank and its stable hostile
  test 172 / 139. The facade's two paired-outcome projections are confined to
  the transfer utility definition; the test has none. Neither file contains
  `Profile.update`, cast, `Eq.ndrec`, tactic `change`, or `Function.update`.
  The test unfolds only the concrete transfer and directly consumes canonical
  `WeaklyDominates` in its positive and negative cases. Warning-clean narrow
  elaboration took about 10--11 seconds for each changed owner and test against
  warm v2 artifacts. The mechanism umbrella compiled warning-clean; fast Phase
  1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 audits reported `VERIFIED=1`. Phase 2 now also checks
  that the two weak-undominance predicates and the implementation predicate are
  each defined exactly once.
- **Outcome / next action:** supports and adopts D54. The general invariant is
  profile recording plus additive evaluation, not v1's kernel hub and not an
  arbitrary solution-set parameter. Keep mixed, correlated, informational,
  VCG, restricted-transfer, price, and attainment families gated by their own
  field-standard consumers. Add the public redirect and require fast audits
  locally plus the hosted full/deep gate before cutover.

### EXP-098: reconcile positive reachability after review cleanup

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-14, hosted run at `52adac51`
- **Status:** completed; hosted gate passed at `e3b5e506` in run
  `31801118321`
- **Decision / question:** process maintenance; whether the review's namespace
  corrections and removal of unused imports left positive deep-reachability
  probes describing the old declaration graph.
- **Representative slice:** compare every reported deep Phase 2 count with its
  expected value, then inspect the exact import root and declaration for every
  mismatch rather than repairing only the first aggregate failure.
- **Evidence / observations:** the full hosted Lean build and Phase 1 passed;
  deep Phase 2 found four stale positive expectations. Two Core declarations
  had always belonged to `GameForm`, not `UtilityGame`; the reusable orthant
  declarations require the `GameTheory.Math.OrthantProjection` root; and the
  Learning facade intentionally stopped importing the unrelated
  approachability theorem. All other reported deep counts matched, including
  EXP-096's six direct repeated-analysis rejections. The first repaired hosted
  run then reported every per-symbol result and `VERIFIED=1`, but the shell
  step exited `1`: the final deliberately unknown Lean constant had left
  PowerShell's native-process exit state uncleared.
- **Outcome / next action:** repair declaration paths and the orthant root,
  remove the phantom Learning input rather than restoring an unused import,
  make every deep probe print its root, declaration, and observed status, and
  clear an expected negative probe's native exit state only after its output
  has been validated.
  Namespace or import cleanup must update its positive reachability probes in
  the same commit. Hosted run `31801118321` passed the full build, Phase 1,
  deep Phase 2, deep Phase 3, and the clean-worktree guard.

### EXP-099: probe the sequential-equilibrium owner directly

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-14, hosted run at `be80a437`
- **Status:** completed; hosted gate passed at `e3b5e506` in run
  `31801118321`
- **Decision / question:** D12 maintenance; whether the public
  `GameTheory.Analysis.Protocol` umbrella still measures the dependency budget
  of its `Sequential` leaf after counterfactual learning graduated into the
  same analytic family.
- **Representative slice:** compare every hosted Phase 3 aggregate with its
  expected value, inspect the umbrella's authored imports, and probe the
  sequential-equilibrium owner rather than weakening its two geometry
  rejections.
- **Evidence / observations:** the full build, Phase 1, and repaired Phase 2
  passed. Exactly one Phase 3 aggregate differed: the broad Protocol-analysis
  umbrella reached `stdSimplex` and `Polynomial`. This is legitimate because
  it now imports counterfactual regret matching, whose engine is
  approachability. `Analysis.Protocol.Sequential` itself imports only the
  finite-law convergence bridge and stable behavioral assessments, matching
  D12's original semantic budget.
- **Outcome / next action:** retain both geometry rejections but attach them to
  `GameTheory.Analysis.Protocol.Sequential`. Give Phase 3 the same exact
  root/declaration diagnostics and expected-native-exit normalization as
  Phase 2. Hosted run `31801118321` passed Phase 3 and the clean-worktree
  check, together with the full build and preceding architecture gates.

### EXP-100: chronological stochastic histories and restart calculus

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-14, reserved after `f52f6836`
- **Status:** completed; supports the projected proof view and graduates the
  smallest client-facing policy/history/restart surface
- **Decision / question:** pre-cutover potential-client usefulness gate;
  whether finite stochastic-game proofs can use chronological `Fin`-indexed
  histories, horizon laws, average payoffs, and continuation/restart identities
  while canonical execution remains the sole Protocol runner.
- **Client evidence:** the independent `UniformEquilibrium` development uses
  chronological `Fin t` histories, first-stage law disintegration, shifted
  behavior profiles, and finite-average-payoff recursion throughout. Treat
  these as field-standard proof patterns, not declarations to preserve.
- **Representative slice:** a two-player, two-state game whose next-state law
  genuinely depends on the joint action. Project canonical realized Protocol
  histories to a proof-free chronological view; identify its horizon law and
  finite-average payoff; restart after a nonempty realized prefix; and consume
  the existing uniform deviation-cap interface without defining another
  equilibrium predicate.
- **Competing designs:** a transparent chronological view projected from
  Protocol histories; a second direct recursive history runner; a total
  equivalence with arbitrary reverse-list information states; or leaving all
  projection and restart reasoning to clients. The direct runner and false
  total equivalence are presumed rejected.
- **Measurements:** public definitions and support theorems, proof-dependent
  transport or casts exposed to the client, definitions unfolded in the
  hostile proof, action-dependence actually used, narrow elaboration time, and
  whether law/payoff/restart results reduce to canonical `runBehavioralFrom`
  composition.
- **Kill conditions:** reject the view if fixed-horizon use requires public
  proof casts, if it duplicates execution or probability semantics, if
  continuation requires a second strategy carrier, or if the action-dependent
  fixture can pass while ignoring the chosen action. Do not graduate a
  UE-named adapter or a specialized quitting-game restart API.
- **Artifacts / observations:** `Stochastic.PublicPolicy` exposes ordinary
  `PublicHistory -> FinDist Action` policies, lossless policy/profile
  equivalences, unilateral-update transport, and a source-shaped one-step law.
  `Stochastic.History` adds the exact list/`Sigma (fun t => Fin t ->
  StageRecord)` equivalence, a support-checked fixed-horizon chronological law,
  proof-free public-history laws, exact public/canonical finite-average payoff
  equality, a public-history characterization of the existing uniform
  deviation-cap constructor, policy shifting, and arbitrary-horizon restart.
  The source-facing successor theorem disintegrates restart laws through
  ordinary joint actions and `Game.transition`; it remains a theorem over the
  sole canonical runner.
- **Hostile result:** `Tests.StochasticContinuation` uses two players and two
  states with `transition _ actions = pure (actions false)`.  It proves the
  true-action and false-action transition laws differ, changes the prescribed
  action after the first observed record, computes the exact two-stage public
  law `[secondRecord, firstRecord]`, maps the fixed `Fin 2` chronological law
  back to it, and independently consumes the arbitrary-horizon restart theorem
  from a realized nonempty prefix.  The source-facing law computation exposes
  no Protocol choice, legality, or support bookkeeping; the separate theorem
  testing continuation from a realized trace has four canonical-construction
  references concentrated in that boundary.
- **Measurements:** the stable policy facade is 315 source lines, the stable
  history/restart facade is 575 lines, and the hostile test is 150 lines at the
  recorded revision.  Source scans find no `cast`, `Eq.ndrec`, direct
  `Function.update`, or new runner definition in those files.  Narrow builds
  of both facades and the hostile test are warning-clean; the final incremental
  hostile build took about 26 seconds on the migration workstation.  The
  fixed-horizon transport uses one generic Protocol support-length invariant;
  all public conversion statements are proof-free.
- **Outcome / next action:** none of the kill conditions fired.  Graduate the
  two facades and the action-dependent test.  Do not add a direct recursive
  stochastic runner, an alternative equilibrium predicate, UE names, or
  quitting-game-specific restart machinery.  Further continuation lemmas are
  consumer-gated algebra over this surface.

### EXP-101: consolidate reusable mathematics under `GameTheory.Math`

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-16, post-cutover `main`
- **Status:** completed; supports D55
- **Decision / question:** whether one public `GameTheory.Math` subtree can own
  the reusable mathematical support, including finite probability, while a
  dotted Lake target and source audit continue to enforce its dependency
  boundary.
- **Competing designs:** retain the unrelated-looking `GameTheoryMath` and
  `GameTheory.Probability` roots; rename without an independently buildable
  target; consolidate under an audited `GameTheory.Math` target; or split a new
  external package immediately. The audited subtree is the smallest design
  that gives clients a coherent namespace and keeps the boundary executable.
- **Representative slice:** move the full former mathematics tree and finite
  probability tree; extract the finite-law/standard-simplex correspondence from
  game analysis, finite-law convergence from the analytic root, and cyclic
  finite-index lemmas from repeated games; retain the law-free vector theorem
  and finite-law adapter as separate sibling modules; rebuild representative
  downstream roots.
- **Measurements:** `lake build GameTheory.Math` passed 2,436 jobs in 66.7
  seconds on a cold local build. Phase 2 reported
  `MATH_FORBIDDEN_IMPORTS=0`, `MATH_GAME_REJECTED=1`, and
  `TRANSPORT_MATH_SOURCE=1` (the accepted internal `FinDist` `change`). The
  subtree contains 3,261 nonblank lines, including 1,633 in finite probability.
  Core passed at 1,753 jobs; Protocol, analytic simplex, Epistemic,
  Evolutionary, and Stochastic passed together at 2,367 jobs.
- **Kill conditions:** reject or narrow if the dotted target conflicts with the
  main target, probability creates a cycle, the math target reaches game
  semantics or fixed points, a second law representation appears, or aliases
  and public transports are required.
- **Outcome / next action:** no kill condition fired. Adopt D55, remove the old
  public roots without compatibility aliases, keep the D21 internal
  vector/finite-law split, and require the target plus authored-import and
  negative-reachability checks at architecture gates. The initial cold
  namespace rebuild passed all 3,610 jobs in 450.1 seconds; after the final
  extractions the default build passed all 3,611 jobs. Deep Phase 2 and Phase 3 passed with
  `VERIFIED=1` in 686.5 and 209.3 seconds respectively. Their runtime confirms
  that compiled reachability belongs at release/CI gates; the ordinary fast
  audits remain the implementation-loop checks. After the convergence and
  finite-rotation extractions, focused umbrella builds passed and targeted
  compiled probes reached finite-law convergence from Math, Analysis learning,
  and sequential consistency while rejecting it from Core and Protocol.

### EXP-102: MAID graphical information reduction

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-16, post-cutover `main`
- **Status:** completed; narrowed, with semantic seam adopted and graphical
  discharge retained as an experiment
- **Decision / question:** whether a graph-derived requisite-information
  certificate can make observation pruning safe in the Koller--Milch sense:
  every Nash equilibrium of the reduced policy space remains a Nash equilibrium
  against the original full policy space.
- **Client evidence:** Milch--Koller safe reduction is the independent target;
  the existing `MAID.ObservationPruning` consumer supplies exact native and
  compiled laws but currently proves only full-space Nash implies reduced-space
  Nash.
- **Competing designs:** derive safety from the existing graph alone; attach a
  proved utility-dependence view to the canonical global utility; store utility
  nodes in MAID syntax; or stop at a semantic full-deviation coverage
  certificate and leave graphical discharge to a later package.
- **Representative slice:** `Tests.MAIDSafeReduction` removes a genuinely fair
  Boolean signal from one decision. When payoff rewards the action alone, the
  always-true reduced profile covers every full deviation and reduced Nash
  lifts to full Nash. With identical execution and pruning but payoff for
  matching the signal, every reduced profile earns `1/2`, copying earns `1`,
  reduced Nash fails after expansion, and coverage is false. The experimental
  graph pair proves nonrequisite `signal -> decision -> reward -> utility` and
  requisite after adding only `signal -> reward`.
- **Measurements:** `ObservationPruning` adds the 11-line
  `CoversFullDeviationsAt` certificate and proves reduced-Nash sufficiency,
  full-Nash necessity, the exact native characterization, and compiled reuse.
  The 445-line semantic consumer unfolds the canonical assignment runner once;
  it adds no evaluator, policy, utility, or equilibrium predicate. The
  479-line graph spike supplies a proved canonical-utility view, effective
  parent graph, set-valued removal/conditioning, ancestral-moral d-connection,
  and two hand-checked controls, but deliberately no semantic soundness claim.
  Focused builds passed warning-free: safe-reduction test 1735 jobs with a
  6.9-second final module build; graph spike 1715 jobs with a 7.2-second final
  module build. Source audit found no `set_option`, `nolint`, `sorry`, `admit`,
  direct `Function.update`, or user-visible transport in the new artifacts.
- **Kill conditions:** reject any graph-only theorem that cannot see utility
  dependence; reject a duplicate evaluator, equilibrium predicate, or policy
  hierarchy; narrow the result if arbitrary full deviations cannot be matched
  by reduced deviations; and change the current pruning API rather than add a
  compatibility layer if the independent safety direction exposes the wrong
  semantic boundary.
- **Outcome / next action:** the graph-only design is killed because canonical
  utility is graph-opaque. Adopt profile-local deviation coverage as the exact
  missing semantic obligation. Retain the one-sink `UtilityView` as a
  conservative experiment: before promotion, replace it with local utility
  terms and prove d-separation constructs coverage on a hostile multi-agent
  consumer. Keep strategic reliance, local observation ignorability, and
  global safe-pruning fixpoints as separate theorem packages.

### EXP-103: local-utility d-separation discharge

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-16, `main` after `47b1c3dc`
- **Status:** completed; representation and semantic bridge validated, graphical
  soundness narrowed to an explicit finite-BN gate
- **Decision / question:** whether an opt-in finite family of owned local
  utility terms plus d-separation can construct
  `ObservationPruning.CoversFullDeviationsAt` for one observation removal,
  without changing stable MAID syntax or restating the semantic conclusion as
  a graph certificate.
- **Client evidence:** the Koller--Milch local ignorability theorem is the
  independent specification. No independent Lean consumer exists; the
  representative proxy is a fair-signal multi-agent value-of-information pair
  in which relevance can flow through another player's signal-dependent rule.
- **Competing designs:** enumerate additive local utility leaves in a proved
  view; use only an extensional dependence certificate for global utility;
  assume a semantic conditional-independence theorem directly; or add utility
  nodes to stable `MAID.Structure`.
- **Representative slice:** remove signal `X` from owner `A`'s decision `D_A`.
  In the live case, rival policy `D_B := X` and payoff `D_A = D_B` make every
  `X`-blind replacement worth at most `1/2` while copying earns `1`, despite no
  direct `X` utility input. The one-edge control removes `X -> D_B`, where
  conditioning on `D_A` blocks the only route to relevant utility. Scope the
  first theorem to one removed site; do not infer simultaneous global pruning.
- **Measurements:** the 821-line requisite-observation spike now uses an exact
  owner-indexed list of additive local utility terms, distinct utility leaves,
  strict decision-descendant relevance, and set-valued conditioning. It retains
  the one-edge chain/live pair and adds two proved decompositions of the same
  canonical utility: split leaves make the signal nonrequisite, while one
  merged leaf creates a conservative false-positive route. The 237-line
  kernel experiment constructs the reduced rule by conditional-fibre
  averaging and proves exact kept-context/action joint-law and expectation
  preservation, including zero-mass fibres. The 190-line MAID bridge packages
  a uniform continuation factorization that mentions neither a reduced
  witness nor an inequality, then constructs
  `CoversFullDeviationsAt` for one unique target site; every untouched owner's
  full policy has an exact reduced preimage. The 149-line finite-BN increment
  proves dependent-value local-factor confinement and multiplicative splitting
  across disjoint parent-closed components, without defining a second joint
  law or conditional-independence predicate.

  Focused builds passed warning-free: requisite observation 1715 jobs with an
  8.1-second final module build; kernel marginalization 1713 jobs; local
  reduction 1736 jobs with a 7.9-second final module build; and finite-BN
  factors 1713 jobs with a 7.4-second final module build. Source audits found
  no `set_option`, `nolint`, `sorry`, `admit`, axiom, direct
  `Function.update`, stored value-domain finiteness, positivity, faithfulness,
  or user-visible equality transport. The full 3616-job build and
  `scripts/phase3-audit.ps1 -VerifyExpected` passed; forbidden imports,
  Protocol/language transport, direct sequential `Function.update`, and
  sequential placeholders/custom axioms remained zero.
- **Kill conditions:** reject a local-utility view that becomes a second payoff
  evaluator; reject any graph hypothesis equivalent by definition to coverage;
  stop before public promotion if the proof needs an unproved global-Markov
  theorem; reject a direct-payoff-only test that misses the rival-policy path;
  and keep the result local if multiple removals require recall or a proved
  elimination sequence.
- **Outcome / next action:** retain the exact local-term view and the
  factorization-to-coverage theorem as experiments. The graph-to-semantics
  claim stopped at its stated kill condition: the repository has no finite-BN
  global-Markov theorem. The next dependency gate is to prove that canonical
  MAID assignment point masses equal the effective-parent local-factor
  product, select a division-free finite-law conditional-independence surface,
  and prove ancestral-moral separation by variable elimination. Only then
  discharge the continuation factorization on the multi-agent rival-policy
  consumer. Do not promote the graphical API or infer simultaneous pruning in
  the meantime.

### EXP-104: finite-BN global-Markov semantics

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-16, `main` at `8e93046f`
- **Status:** complete; finite global-Markov soundness and canonical MAID
  application validated
- **Decision / question:** whether the canonical typed MAID assignment law can
  support a reusable finite global-Markov theorem without a second evaluator,
  positivity or faithfulness assumptions, stored value-domain finiteness, or
  division by zero-probability evidence.
- **Client evidence:** the Koller--Milch local ignorability theorem is the
  independent specification. Its required soundness direction is graphical
  d-separation to probabilistic conditional independence for every
  parameterization; the existing `LocalUtilityFactorsAt` bridge is the target
  consumer once that probability theorem exists.
- **Competing designs:** prove point-mass factorization directly for canonical
  native MAID execution; expose only a proved factorization view; introduce a
  generic finite Bayesian-network joint evaluator; or formulate the Markov
  result recursively over the existing serialized assignment runner.
- **Representative slice:** establish effective-parent point-mass products for
  a typed three-node chain, then exercise division-free conditional
  independence on independent, chain, and collider controls including
  zero-mass conditioning events. The eventual hostile MAID remains the
  multi-agent rival-policy path from EXP-103.
- **Measurements:** the 347-line canonical factorization module defines typed
  effective-parent kernels, identifies them with the existing assignment node
  laws, and proves by a nodup dependency-compatible list invariant that every
  accepted topological serialization has the local-factor point masses. The
  order-free native evaluator inherits the exact `Finset.univ` factorization;
  a typed signal/decision/reward MAID consumes the generic theorem. No second
  evaluator is introduced.

  The 232-line finite-law module defines conditional independence by the
  division-free atom identity `P(x,y,z)P(z)=P(x,z)P(y,z)`, proves symmetry and
  zero-mass subevent closure, accepts deterministic and impossible-evidence
  controls, and rejects a fair shared-diagonal bit. The 339-line cylinder
  module connects an explicitly factorizing law to finite cylinder sums,
  proves one-coordinate parent/local/product invariance and normalized reverse
  elimination, and exercises both factor normalization and an impossible
  Boolean cylinder. Focused builds passed warning-free: canonical MAID
  factorization 1736 jobs with a 7.3-second final module build; conditional
  independence 1713 jobs with a 10-second final module build; cylinder
  marginalization 1716 jobs. Source audits found no `set_option`, `nolint`,
  placeholder, axiom, direct `Function.update`, public cast, positivity, or
  faithfulness premise. The full 3619-job build and
  `scripts/phase3-audit.ps1 -VerifyExpected` passed with all forbidden-import,
  transport, direct sequential-update, placeholder, and custom-axiom counts at
  their expected zero values.

  The next 258-line dependent-enumeration increment makes `AgreeOn` the single
  lower-layer definition, constructs a cast-free equivalence from agreeing
  total assignments to complement configurations, reindexes filtered sums,
  and proves the one-pivot nested-sum/Fubini law with a Boolean bijection
  control. The 229-line coordinate module is a transparent specialization of
  the existing observable CI predicate, not a parallel notion; it gives exact
  cylinder forms and a dependent zero-evidence control. The 122-line rank-one
  module proves all marginal-sum and cross-product identities over any
  commutative semiring, accepts `[[3,4],[6,8]]`, and rejects the diagonal
  matrix. Their focused builds passed warning-free (1714, 1716, and 924 jobs,
  respectively), again without options, lint suppressions, placeholders,
  casts, positivity, or nonempty assumptions. The integrated 3622-job build and
  phase-3 architecture verification also passed with all expected zero counts.

  The 567-line marginalization module now iterates the proved one-pivot Fubini
  and atomic elimination laws along a dependency-compatible pending list. Its
  public theorem shows that every cylinder on a parent-closed retained set has
  exactly the retained factor product, with no positivity premise; a two-node
  Boolean chain eliminates its leaf and retains normalized root mass one. The
  193-line factor-scope module proves that a disjoint factor-index partition
  constructs multiplicatively separated left/right scores whose coordinate
  sets may overlap on evidence. The 297-line generic graph module implements
  ancestor restriction, moralization, then evidence deletion; factor scopes
  form cliques. Chain controls separate only when the middle is observed, while
  collider controls are separated unconditionally and opened by observing the
  middle. Focused builds passed warning-free (1717, 1714, and 794 jobs) with no
  stored finiteness, alternate evaluator, option, lint suppression, placeholder,
  cast, positivity, or faithfulness premise. The integrated 3624-job build and
  phase-3 architecture verification passed with all expected zero counts.

  The 288-line component module uses operation-local node finiteness to turn
  separation into explicit left/right open ancestral regions, assign neutral
  components deterministically, partition ancestral factor indices, and prove
  every factor scope lies on its side plus evidence. The 196-line MAID bridge
  identifies typed one-, two-, and three-restriction cylinders with generic
  `AgreeOn` cylinders on coordinate unions and rewrites coordinate CI to the
  four generic cylinder masses. The 114-line carrier-relative latent module
  splits complement configurations into left/right dependent configurations
  and reindexes filtered cylinder sums as nested sums. Its partition
  certificate stores no finite capability; `[Fintype Node]` occurs only on the
  summation theorem. Focused builds passed warning-free (1717, 1720, and 1715
  jobs), with no casts, alternate evaluators, positivity, or hidden
  conditioning convention. The integrated 3627-job build and phase-3
  architecture verification passed with all expected zero counts.

  The first real global-Markov composition exposed a bad boundary in the
  whole-node latent partition: using it after ancestor marginalization would
  require transporting every dependent configuration and factor score through
  an ancestral-node subtype. The greenfield API was changed directly. The
  148-line latent module now partitions an explicit retained set, requires no
  node enumeration, and rejects overlapping latent blocks while accepting
  empty blocks and singleton value domains. The 253-line retained-cylinder
  module partitions a query cylinder into exact retained cylinders and, for a
  parent-closed retained set, rewrites each term to the canonical local-factor
  product. The 601-line score adapter assembles arbitrary disjoint query
  configurations, preserves every typed coordinate, consumes scope-derived
  `DependsOnlyOn` certificates, and proves rank-one cross multiplication; a
  nonconstant product score passes while a diagonal table is rejected. The
  65-line MAID bridge also packages the canonical native law as the same
  `Factorizes` interface and transports the causal topological order to
  effective parents. Focused builds passed warning-free (1719, 1722, and 1742
  jobs), without a second evaluator, subtype transport, stored finiteness,
  positivity, or compatibility shim. The integrated 3630-job build and phase-3
  architecture verification passed with all expected zero counts.

  The final composition adds 223 lines of moral-component-to-score plumbing,
  420 lines of probability-only query-cylinder Fubini, and a 60-line exact
  identification of the retained factor table with canonical cylinder mass.
  The 249-line soundness theorem selects a default assignment from the law's
  nonempty support, assembles arbitrary dependent query configurations, applies
  rank-one cross multiplication, and rewrites its point, row, column, and total
  terms to the four division-free cylinder masses. The 57-line MAID corollary
  uses the existing native law, effective kernels, and causal topological order.

  Three hostile consumers close the gate. A 153-line canonical all-chance MAID
  sends a fair Boolean root through a `Fin 3` middle coordinate and proves
  endpoint CI for arbitrary typed configurations when the middle is observed,
  while rejecting the unconditioned graph. A 268-line explicit collider law
  proves factorization, accepts independent roots without evidence, and rejects
  conditioning on either the collider or its descendant. A 159-line
  deterministic chain proves an unsupported `middle = true` evidence cylinder
  has mass zero and instantiates the final cross-product theorem at that exact
  configuration. Focused builds passed warning-free (1726, 1723, 1754, 1756,
  and 1732 jobs), with no positivity, faithfulness, nontriviality, stored
  capability, second evaluator, or conditional-law convention. The integrated
  3638-job build and phase-3 architecture verification passed with all expected
  zero counts.
- **Kill conditions:** reject a second authoritative MAID evaluator, custom
  axiom, positivity or faithfulness premise, `Fintype.ofFinite` in executable
  code, or conditional law equality that is undefined on zero evidence; keep
  the result experimental if ancestral-moral elimination still depends on an
  unproved normalization or representation theorem.
- **Outcome / next action:** supported. Every finite dependent-domain law that
  factorizes over normalized local kernels satisfies coordinate conditional
  independence when its disjoint query blocks are separated in the ancestral
  moral graph. Canonical native MAID play inherits the theorem through its
  proved effective-parent factorization. Keep the result experimental while
  building finite configuration-valued utility leaves; next prove their mapped
  canonical law factorizes, then add the replacement-invariance lemmas needed
  to turn local graphical ignorability into the existing non-circular
  continuation certificate and `CoversFullDeviationsAt`.

### EXP-105: finite utility leaves and replacement-invariant continuations

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-16, `main` at `6a0717bb`
- **Status:** complete; one-site graphical ignorability constructs
  full-deviation coverage and the safe/live relay consumer is validated
- **Decision / question:** whether the experiment-only additive `UtilityView`
  can augment canonical native MAID play with distinct finite
  configuration-valued utility leaves, inherit the proved finite-BN
  factorization/global-Markov theorem, and construct a replacement-independent
  local continuation certificate without adding utility nodes to stable syntax
  or defining another evaluator.
- **Competing designs:** map canonical play to base assignments plus one finite
  parent-configuration leaf per utility term; use one merged owner sink; store
  utility nodes in canonical `Structure`; or bypass the distributional seam
  with a direct expected-utility hypothesis.
- **Representative slice:** preserve distinct coordination and background
  utility terms; prove the mapped law factorizes with deterministic leaf
  kernels; then test the two-player relay path where a rival either ignores or
  copies the removed signal. The safe case must construct the existing
  `LocalUtilityFactorsAt`/coverage seam, while the relay case must remain live.
- **Kill conditions:** reject a second play evaluator, an `ℝ`-valued finite BN
  node, a merged utility sink that introduces false moral edges, a continuation
  selected separately for each replacement, a stored player/node/value
  finiteness capability, or a theorem that silently generalizes one-site safety
  to simultaneous same-owner pruning.
- **Measurements:** the first 115-line gate defines dependent graph values with
  canonical base fibers and exact finite parent-configuration utility fibers,
  an injective deterministic augmentation with a base projection, and the
  summed owner payoff. The payoff on every augmented canonical assignment is
  proved equal to `Semantics.utility` from the additive `UtilityView`
  certificate. The existing split reward/signal fixture consumes the theorem,
  so distinct terms are not silently merged. Its 1716-job focused build passed
  warning-free with no finiteness, decidable-equality, positivity, alternate
  evaluator, real-valued BN carrier, transport, or compatibility assumption.

  The second gate adds 373 lines of operation-local graph enumeration,
  cast-free base and utility parent configurations, deterministic leaf
  kernels tied to the same certified semantics, and a leaves-last topological
  order that stores no finite-carrier capability. A 279-line mapped-law proof
  covers both canonical augmented assignments and hostile inconsistent
  targets: the latter have zero mapped mass and a witnessed zero Dirac utility
  factor. The resulting `Factorizes` theorem needs node finiteness only where
  canonical native play and the finite product need it, and no value-domain
  finiteness or decidable equality. The distinct split-term consumer passes.

  Two downstream seams also compile independently. The 180-line graph bridge
  identifies MAID `DConnected` exactly with singleton generic ancestral-moral
  connectivity, derives `Separates` from the existing set-valued ignorability
  predicate, and proves the three query/evidence disjointness premises from
  acyclicity. The 241-line distributional bundle stores one replacement-
  invariant context law, shared relevant-term continuation kernels, and exact
  nonrelevant-term marginals, then assembles them into the existing
  `LocalUtilityFactorsAt` without mentioning a reduced witness, preference, or
  coverage inequality. Its assembly needs no value finiteness and no one-site
  shape. The four-module 1749-job build passed warning-free, with no
  `set_option`, `nolint`, placeholder, axiom, direct function update, visible
  transport, alternate evaluator, positivity premise, or compatibility shim.

  The third gate proves two exact prerequisites without strengthening the
  semantic conclusion. A 142-line generic theorem shows that two factorizing
  finite dependent laws have the same retained-coordinate pushforward when
  the retained set is parent-closed and their kernels agree there; its
  fallback assignment comes from the first law's nonempty support. An 84-line
  MAID theorem then combines mapped-law factorization, the leaves-last order,
  setwise separation, and finite global Markov to prove division-free
  conditional independence between the whole removed-observation coordinate
  set and one relevant utility-configuration leaf for any fixed canonical
  policy. Because the EXP-104 public wrapper still uses `Structure` only to
  name its dependent
  assignment fibers, the latter theorem records one reducible all-chance
  proof view of the already-canonical augmented graph; it defines no runner or
  law. The combined 1759-job build passed warning-free with the same zero
  hazard counts.

  A further 239-line probability-only theorem constructs a canonical
  continuation by conditioning the `(kept context, term)` law on its kept
  fibre. Division-free conditional independence of full context and term given
  kept context then reconstructs their exact joint law by binding that
  continuation after the context marginal. The public equality contains no
  division, and its proof shows that the arbitrary `condOnFibre` fallback is
  never observed on a zero-mass kept fibre. The set-valued graph proof was also
  strengthened directly rather than combining singleton CI claims: every
  removed observation is already an ancestor of the conditioned decision, so
  the larger query adds no ancestral-moral vertices. The combined 1759-job
  build remained warning-free with all hazard counts zero.

  The fourth gate reaches both sides of the replacement-uniform boundary
  without crossing it prematurely. A 247-line canonical-execution proof
  splits the accepted topological serialization at the target decision,
  proves that a unique-site owner replacement cannot alter the prefix, and
  constructs one `ReplacementContextLawAt`: for every replacement the target
  context has the same law and its action is drawn from exactly that
  replacement kernel. It uses no conditional probability and no finite or
  decidable value-fibre assumption. Separately, a 510-line cast-free recoding
  identifies the removed graph configuration, utility singleton, and
  decision-plus-kept evidence with their exact typed MAID configurations.
  This turns the set-valued graph CI into full-context/action independence and
  feeds the probability-only theorem to recover the exact fixed-policy joint
  continuation law. It explicitly stops short of choosing a continuation per
  replacement. The combined 1765-job build passed warning-free with all
  hazard counts zero.

  The fifth gate closes the relevant-term replacement boundary. A 381-line
  canonical target-surgery proof shows pointwise that an arbitrary target rule
  contributes exactly its selected action mass times the corresponding
  constant-action intervention mass; the prefix and action-indexed suffix are
  shared, including at unsupported contexts. A 392-line constructor then
  chooses each action's continuation from that constant-action augmented law,
  applies the fixed-policy graphical CI result, and uses the surgery identity
  to prove one `TermContinuationLawAt` works for every owner replacement. The
  kept index is the actual pruning-kept configuration paired with the target
  action, and the removal remains set-valued. No continuation is selected
  after seeing a replacement, and no division, positivity, or additional
  value-fibre assumption beyond global Markov enters. The combined 1767-job
  build passed warning-free with all hazard counts zero.

  The sixth gate closes the nonrelevant branch. A 357-line theorem package
  restricts two canonical augmented laws to the parent-closed ancestors of a
  nonrelevant utility leaf, proves their kernels agree there when the owner has
  one decision site, and maps the resulting law equality back to the term's
  exact base-parent configuration. The expanded policy supplies the reference
  marginal, so no default or inhabitance choice enters the certificate. A
  hostile universe instantiation also exposed an honest scope condition:
  transparent configuration-valued leaves live in `Type (max uNode uValue)`.
  Supporting a strictly lower base-value universe would require `ULift` and
  transport, so the augmentation and its sole proof-only graph wrapper now
  state the no-transport signature
  `Structure.{uPlayer, uNode, max uNode uValue}` explicitly. The combined
  five-target build completed 1769 jobs warning-free, and the final
  nonrelevant target rebuilt in 1764 jobs with all hazard counts zero.

  The final gate is a 100-line generic assembly from set-valued graphical
  ignorability to `ReplacementInvariantUtilityLawAt`, then to
  `LocalUtilityFactorsAt`, and finally to `CoversFullDeviationsAt` under the
  explicit one-site pruning shape. Relevant terms use one replacement-uniform
  continuation; nonrelevant terms use the parent-closed kernel-invariant
  marginal. The 802-line hostile consumer proves coverage and exact Nash
  transfer when the rival is signal-blind. When the rival relays the signal,
  the observation is requisite and not graphically ignorable, and a copying
  full deviation earns `3/2` while every blind reduced replacement earns `1`,
  so semantic coverage is explicitly false. The focused consumer build passed
  warning-free; source audits found no option, lint suppression, placeholder,
  axiom, direct update, visible transport, representation leak, or compatibility
  shim.
- **Outcome / next action:** supported for one unique pruned decision site.
  Finite utility augmentation, mapped-law factorization, set-valued graphical
  separation, replacement-uniform relevant continuations, nonrelevant marginal
  invariance, and graph-free utility-law assembly now discharge the existing
  semantic coverage certificate on the hostile safe case without certifying
  the live relay. The graphical package remains experimental. This result does
  not imply simultaneous same-owner pruning or strategic reliance. The next
  information-reduction gate is the global safe-pruning fixpoint under its
  sufficient-recall condition; strategic reliance remains a separate package.

### EXP-106: exact approximate-Nash transport across policy equivalences

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-16, `main` at `b4aee27f`
- **Status:** complete; supports a theorem with direct hypotheses and rejects
  profile equivalence plus payoff conjugacy alone
- **Decision / question:** whether exact profile-policy equivalences,
  two-way unilateral-update reflection, and arbitrary-profile expected-payoff
  equality suffice to transport canonical `IsεNash` without reviving the
  transformation or semantic-certificate hierarchies rejected by D7 and D8.
- **Competing designs:** one theorem parameterized by an ordinary profile
  equivalence and explicit hypotheses; direct language-local proofs; or a new
  form/runner/equilibrium transport structure with composition laws.
- **Representative slice:** first consume explicit-order FOSG serialization,
  where target histories contain administrative microsteps and payoff equality
  requires erasure. Independently consume native/compiled MAID play, where one
  owner replacement changes its complete family of site-local rules. Both must
  preserve the same epsilon through the canonical `IsεNash` predicate; exact
  expected-utility Nash may appear only as the zero-slack corollary.
- **Kill conditions:** reject a second equilibrium predicate, a transport
  certificate hierarchy, hidden deviation reflection, equality only at the
  baseline profile, a stored finiteness capability, direct function update,
  visible equality transport, an option or lint suppression, placeholder,
  custom axiom, or a claim that pointwise horizon transport automatically
  preserves eventual uniform equilibrium or long-run payoff.
- **Measurements / observations:**
  [`Core/Approximate.lean`](../GameTheory/Core/Approximate.lean) now exposes
  `isεNash_iff_of_profileEquiv_of_expectedUtility_eq` with only an ordinary
  profile equivalence, named same-player update reflection in both directions,
  and expected-utility equality at every target profile. The stable
  [`FOSGToEFGStrategic.lean`](../GameTheory/Languages/Bridges/FOSGToEFGStrategic.lean)
  consumer preserves the same real epsilon for arbitrary serialized target
  profiles and for translated source profiles. The independent stable
  [`MAID/Strategic.lean`](../GameTheory/Languages/MAID/Strategic.lean) consumer
  preserves the same epsilon while one deviation replaces one source owner's
  complete site-local policy family. Both exact-Nash theorems are now the
  zero-slack corollaries.

  The hostile
  [`ApproximateEquilibriumTransport.lean`](../GameTheory/Tests/ApproximateEquilibriumTransport.lean)
  test swaps two player coordinates and conjugates payoffs exactly at every
  profile. Its target base profile is zero-slack Nash while the source base
  profile is not, and the same-player forward update-reflection premise is
  explicitly false. Thus a profile bijection plus payoff equality cannot
  silently replace deviation reflection. The combined command
  `lake build GameTheory.Core.Approximate GameTheory.Languages.Bridges.FOSGToEFGStrategic GameTheory.Languages.MAID.Strategic GameTheory.Tests.ApproximateEquilibriumTransport`
  completed 1,738 jobs warning-free.
- **Outcome / next action:** support and promote the direct theorem, not a
  transformation structure or equilibrium-transport certificate. The result
  is pointwise in one form, profile, utility, and real epsilon. It neither
  quantifies over horizons nor transports eventual uniform equilibrium,
  infinite-path laws, or long-run payoffs. Reconsider a structure only after
  two independent composition consumers require one.

### EXP-107: sufficient-recall MAID pruning fixpoint

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-16, `main` at `454198dc` plus the active
  EXP-107 global working tree
- **Status:** complete (experiment-only; no stable/public promotion)
- **Decision / question:** whether a pruning that is stable under restoring all
  original observations at each queried decision can construct
  `CoversFullDeviationsAt` when each owner's induced relevance graph is
  acyclic, with edges witnessed by original-graph s-reachability, matching the
  sufficient-recall boundary of Milch--Koller rather than causal DAG
  acyclicity or Protocol perfect recall.
- **Competing designs:** an experiment-only parent-map view with a hybrid
  restore-at-site graph and mechanism-node s-reachability; iterating the
  one-site theorem; or assuming relative semantic coverage at every step.
- **Representative slice:** one owner with early and late Boolean decisions.
  The positive fixture removes the same signal at both sites while retaining
  the early-to-late recall edge. Separately instantiate the source's Forgetful
  Movie Star graph and rational payoffs, checking its fixpoint, relevance
  cycle, and paper-described uniform profile under that explicit payoff
  instantiation through canonical execution.
- **Kill conditions:** reject tests performed only in the final reduced graph,
  one-missing-edge-at-a-time restoration, causal acyclicity mislabeled as
  sufficient recall, reuse of the unique-site theorem as a multi-site proof,
  a second evaluator or equilibrium predicate, hidden semantic coverage,
  positivity or faithfulness, stored finiteness, compatibility aliases,
  source options or unexplained lint suppressions, placeholders, custom
  axioms, direct function update, or visible equality transport.
- **Measurements / observations:** the experimental graph layer now restores
  the whole missing set at one target, leaves other decisions at the candidate
  pruning, adds a genuine dummy mechanism root for original-graph
  s-reachability, and states same-owner acyclicity with the source's edge
  orientation. Canonical candidate and hybrid laws factorize over those exact
  graphs. Multi-site site surgery, one shared target-context law, exact
  behavioral-rule multilinearity, finite site-rule optimality, and the
  graph-free kept-context averaging theorem compile without `target_unique`.
  The under-graph global-Markov consumer is division-free and fixed-law only.
  The foundation artifacts are

  [`MAIDSiteOptimality.lean`](../GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/MAIDSiteOptimality.lean),
  and
  [`MAIDSiteLocalReduction.lean`](../GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/MAIDSiteLocalReduction.lean).
  `MAIDPruningRelevantContinuation` constructs the relevant utility term's
  replacement-uniform continuation for arbitrary target rules. The independent
  [`MAIDPruningFixpointPositiveTest.lean`](../GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/MAIDPruningFixpointPositiveTest.lean)
  proves the edge-addition fixpoint, acyclic owner relevance graph, direct
  semantic coverage, and reduced/expanded Nash; it does not consume an
  unfinished global theorem. `MAIDPruningSiteReduction` now assembles
  `siteLocalUtilityFactorsAt_of_edgeAdditionStableAt` and proves
  `exists_reduced_isOptimalSiteRule_of_edgeAdditionStableAt`; these are
  site-local endpoints, not the unfinished global induction. The recall-order
  module supplies reduced-site surgery, fully mixed initialization, and the
  source-first owner order. The mechanism-selector module proves that a fair
  mixture of the baseline and one source-rule surgery factorizes over the
  exact dummy-root graph used by s-reachability. Its independence companion
  derives selector/utility conditional independence and the division-free
  baseline-versus-changed component cross-product identity. The score layer
  sums that identity against each finite term payoff and proves that a changed
  source cannot create a target full-action atom outside the fully mixed
  reference support, without assuming chance positivity. The site-score layer
  adds exact off-target surgery algebra, shared context marginals, zero-mass
  collapse, and a finite expected-utility decomposition into unnormalised
  context/action/term scores. The foundation set now contains sixteen
  artifacts, and the two consumer audits are separate. Before the two score
  modules landed, the aggregate `lake build` over the original fourteen
  artifacts plus those consumers completed warning-free with 1,785 jobs, and
  the repository-wide `lake build` completed with 3,673 jobs.
  `phase1-audit.ps1 -VerifyExpected`,
  `phase2-audit.ps1 -VerifyExpected -DeepReachability`, and
  `phase3-audit.ps1 -VerifyExpected -DeepReachability` each reported
  `VERIFIED=1`. The source audit found no option, lint suppression,
  placeholder, custom axiom, direct update, or visible transport.

  [`MAIDForgetfulMovieStarAudit.lean`](../GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/MAIDForgetfulMovieStarAudit.lean)
  validates the source-shaped edge-addition fixpoint and the two-way
  s-reachability cycle. With star utility `2 * avoid + consistency`, canonical
  execution gives the proposed independent-uniform reduced profile utility
  `3/2`, while the legal reduced whole-owner constant-equal deviation gives
  `2`; thus that profile is not reduced Nash. More generally, in this exact
  dependency class every sponsorship-contingent full deviation is a convex
  combination of deterministic reduced whole-owner plans against the fixed
  robot law. The paper's qualitative profile therefore cannot serve as the
  requested unsafe behavioral consumer.
- **Measurements / observations (continued):** the selector cross-law,
  division-free finite term-score comparison, and changed-to-reference
  full-action support theorem compile without chance positivity. The global
  chain is complete: `SReachAcyclic` and `IsEdgeAdditionFixpoint` give a
  source-first fully mixed initialization; one-source non-s-reachability
  transport preserves each site optimum while later source rules are
  installed; the source-first induction produces an existential reduced
  whole-owner policy dominating every full owner replacement; and the final
  theorem discharges `CoversFullDeviationsAt`. The positive consumer retains
  its independent direct coverage proof and additionally consumes the generic
  theorem. The exact focused build for the global theorem and positive
  consumer completed warning-free with 1,789/1,789 jobs. The theorem has no
  positivity premise and no `Fintype Player` requirement; finite node/value
  enumerations remain local to the finite execution operation. The
  source-shaped Forgetful Movie Star audit remains a recall-cycle sentinel,
  not an unsafe coverage consumer: its explicit `2 * avoid + consistency`
  profile is beaten by a legal reduced whole-owner deviation. All listed kill
  conditions are therefore discharged for this experiment, while the result
  remains experiment-only and makes no simultaneous claim beyond the stated
  theorem. The final full repository build passed warning-free with 3,678
  jobs, and the deep Phase 1--3 architecture audits each reported
  `VERIFIED=1`; in particular `TRANSPORT_POST_ARCHITECTURE=0`.
- **Outcome / next action:** supports the hybrid graph, factorization,
  nonrelevant-term invariance, site-local optimality, non-s-reachability
  transport, and sufficient-recall global coverage chain. Do not promote the
  experimental graph predicates or add an executable pruning pass yet.
  EXP-109 subsequently validated exact executable fixpoint checking but not
  pruning construction or minimality; reopen those or a
  strategic-reliance/public-promotion decision only when an independent
  consumer requires it. Preserve the finite-support/countable-layer
  separation; EXP-108 remains the distinct gate for infinite-path laws and
  cyclic uniformity.

### EXP-108: infinite-path order of limits and cyclic subgame-perfect uniformity

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-16, post-cutover working tree; reserved after
  the EXP-107 MAID gate close-out
- **Status:** in progress; future architecture gate; no public API adopted
- **Decision / question:** whether an opt-in measurable infinite-play layer can
  state and keep separate the three payoff aggregations
  `E[liminf_T A_T]`, `E[limsup_T A_T]`, and `lim_T E[A_T]`, and whether a
  phase-indexed quitting-game interface can state cyclic subgame-perfect
  uniform equilibrium without identifying it with terminal or
  limiting-average equilibrium.
- **Representative slice:** first, a one-state one-player Boolean-action
  process whose randomized first action selects complementary bounded action
  sequences with Cesàro liminf `0` and limsup `1`; every finite-horizon expected
  average is `1/2`, while the expected pathwise liminf is `0` and expected
  pathwise limsup is `1`. Second, a two-player two-phase quitting/cyclic
  continuation fixture in which the initial phase passes a terminal check but
  a profitable deviation exists after the other phase, so a cyclic interface
  must quantify every phase/subgame root.
- **Competing designs:** add an infinite-play measure above the existing finite
  laws and retain one canonical runner; add a second recursive stochastic
  runner; or leave pathwise/order-of-limits semantics to clients. For cyclic
  play, compare an all-phase continuation certificate with an initial-phase
  terminal check. The second runner and the initial-only cyclic check are
  presumed rejected.
- **Measurements:** exact pathwise and expected definitions for all three
  aggregations; finite-marginal projection to the existing horizon laws;
  presence or absence of expectation/limit interchange assumptions; whether
  terminal, limiting-average, and uniform predicates remain separate at the
  type/signature level; and whether every cyclic phase is covered by the
  subgame condition.
- **Kill conditions:** silently identify any two aggregations; infer an
  expectation/liminf or expectation/limsup interchange without boundedness and
  the required convergence direction; duplicate Protocol/stochastic running
  semantics; let an initial-phase certificate stand for cyclic
  subgame-perfection; or add coercions between terminal, limiting-average, and
  uniform equilibrium concepts.
- **Evidence / boundary:** the independent sibling consumer's
  `InfinitePlayMeasure.lean` and `LiminfAverageBridge.lean` provide a measured
  reference for Ionescu--Tulcea construction, finite-marginal projection,
  pathwise averages, Fatou/reverse-Fatou directionality, and the extra
  almost-sure-convergence hypothesis. Its quitting cyclic compiler supplies a
  phasewise Nash--Bellman/absorption pattern, but does not itself establish a
  cyclic SPE predicate. Stable `GameTheory` surfaces remain finite-law; the
  experiment below validates a separate measurable path layer but does not
  authorize promotion.
- **Observations:** the 143-line
  [`AsymptoticPayoffSeparation.lean`](../GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/AsymptoticPayoffSeparation.lean)
  uses one fair two-point `FinDist` over a stage sequence and its unit
  complement. It proves every finite expected Cesàro average is `1/2` and,
  from four explicit endpoint hypotheses, proves expected pathwise liminf is
  `0` while expected pathwise limsup is `1`. The focused target builds
  warning-free with 1,713 jobs; the 3,673-job full build and deep Phase 1--3
  audits pass. The schema introduces no runner, measure, equilibrium predicate,
  or coercion. The 438-line
  [`AsymptoticOscillatingSequence.lean`](../GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/AsymptoticOscillatingSequence.lean)
  constructs squaring block endpoints and alternating `0`/`1` stages, proves
  exact block sums and global Cesàro bounds, proves the endpoint ratio tends to
  zero, and squeezes cofinal even and odd endpoint subsequences to `0` and `1`.
  The resulting filter theorem proves the sequence and its complement both
  have Cesàro liminf `0` and limsup `1`, and instantiates the generic fair
  two-point theorem: expected pathwise liminf is `0`, every finite expected
  average and its limit are `1/2`, and expected pathwise limsup is `1`. The
  focused target builds warning-free with 1,714 jobs and the source audit finds
  no option, lint suppression, placeholder, axiom, direct update, visible
  transport, runner, measure, equilibrium predicate, or coercion.
- **Finite-marginal measure slice:** the 405-line
  [`StochasticInfinitePlayMeasure.lean`](../GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/StochasticInfinitePlayMeasure.lean)
  builds a Mathlib `Kernel.traj` from the canonical one-step
  `runBehavioralFrom` law and proves that every chronological projection is
  exactly the measure induced by the existing `chronologicalHistoryLaw`.
  `lake build GameTheory.Experimental.PostArchitecture.StochasticInfinitePlayMeasure`
  passed 3,011 jobs warning-free. The construction introduces no second
  runner or payoff notion; its discrete bridge assumes finite players,
  nonempty action fibers, and countable canonical histories. The phase-2
  boundary audit counts its 13 representation tokens and 7 `toPMF` uses
  separately from the stable zero-leak bucket.
- **Measured payoff-interface slice:** the 311-line
  [`StochasticAsymptoticPayoffs.lean`](../GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/StochasticAsymptoticPayoffs.lean)
  defines `E[liminf Aₙ]`, `E[limsup Aₙ]`, and convergence of `E[Aₙ]`
  separately as total Bochner-integral/filter expressions. Its countable
  bridge requires an explicit pointwise bound, and the concrete alternating
  block consumer proves the three values `0`, `1 / 2`, and `1` for those exact
  definitions. `lake build
  GameTheory.Experimental.PostArchitecture.StochasticAsymptoticPayoffs`
  passed 3,016 jobs warning-free. No expectation/limit interchange, coercion,
  equilibrium notion, or unconditional unbounded expectation is asserted.
- **Outcome / next action:** supports the distinct-signature/order-of-limits
  boundary, completes its finite-law hostile witness, and validates an
  experiment-only infinite-play measure whose finite marginals are canonical,
  plus distinct measured payoff signatures with a bounded hostile consumer.
  EXP-113 now connects a nonconstant canonical game path and proves its exact
  expected-average limit and both pathwise order-limit expectations. EXP-114
  is the remaining cyclic gate: its provisional all-phase predicate compiles,
  but the hostile off-phase test requires a public event/transition congruence
  theorem that retains the joint action after unilateral profile update.
  Preserve current `supported`/`opt-in` statuses and prototype only under
  `Experimental` until that hostile slice and a follow-up decision record
  determine the dependency and public API boundary.

### EXP-109: executable MAID edge-addition fixpoint checker

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-16, `main` at `cb4fce62`
- **Status:** complete checker-only result; experiment-only; no public API adopted
- **Decision / question:** whether a caller-supplied topological node list and
  finite utility-site enumeration can decide `IsEdgeAdditionStableAt` and
  `IsEdgeAdditionFixpoint` without storing `Fintype`, invoking classical graph
  construction, or claiming a unique/minimal pruning.
- **Representative slice:** executable directed ancestry, ancestral-moral
  adjacency, and reachability over explicit node lists; Boolean checkers with
  iff the existing propositions; the existing positive multi-site fixpoint,
  safe/live relay, split/merged utility, empty-utility, and recall-cycle
  controls; plus one order-sensitive two-observation fixture.
- **Competing designs:** an explicit-list checker over the current experimental
  graph; a proof-only decidability instance over `Fintype`; or an executable
  Add-Edges constructor that also claims minimality. Prefer the checker. Reject
  stored/global finiteness and defer construction/minimality until termination,
  order dependence, and confluence are measured.
- **Measurements:** source-level classical/transport/finiteness tokens;
  checker/proposition equivalence; graph enumeration size; focused build;
  whether setwise restore-all checks agree with one-at-a-time deletion; and
  whether any order-independent minimality theorem is actually provable.
- **First checkpoint:**
  [`FiniteDirectedReachability.lean`](../GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/FiniteDirectedReachability.lean)
  proves an explicit-list Warshall checker equivalent to canonical
  `Relation.ReflTransGen` and exercises directed, disconnected, reflexive, and
  cyclic controls.
  [`MAIDGraphDeciders.lean`](../GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/MAIDGraphDeciders.lean)
  enumerates one owner's base and utility graph nodes from the supplied causal
  topological order and decides directed and ancestral-moral one-step edges.
  `lake build GameTheory.Experimental.PostArchitecture.FiniteDirectedReachability
  GameTheory.Experimental.PostArchitecture.MAIDGraphDeciders` passed 1,741
  jobs warning-free. Both files contain zero forbidden execution, transport,
  placeholder, option, or lint-suppression tokens; no line exceeds 100 columns.
- **Kill conditions:** a second graph semantics, `Fintype.ofFinite` or
  `open Classical` in executable code, a constructor without a returned
  fixpoint certificate, silently treating setwise and singleton removal as
  interchangeable, or claiming maximal removal/minimal kept edges without a
  hostile confluence proof.
- **Final observations:**
  [`MAIDPruningFixpointChecker.lean`](../GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/MAIDPruningFixpointChecker.lean)
  is a 417-line executable composition of the existing graph. It proves exact
  iff theorems for directed relevance, ancestral-moral connectivity,
  `DConnectedUnder`, site stability, and the full fixpoint. Callers supply a
  causal topological order and a complete player list; no `Fintype Player` or
  stored carrier enumeration is introduced. Filtering the supplied causal
  order over each missing-observation `Finset` avoids the sole noncomputable
  `Finset.toList` route, and a compiled one-decision control reduces to `true`.
  [`MAIDPruningFixpointCheckerTest.lean`](../GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/MAIDPruningFixpointCheckerTest.lean)
  is a 68-line independent consumer: both the nonconstant two-site positive
  fixture and the Movie Star recall-cycle fixture pass the checker through the
  exact proposition equivalence, and each result extracts the canonical
  `IsEdgeAdditionFixpoint` certificate. The focused consumer build passed
  1,794 jobs warning-free. Source audits found no second graph, stored
  finiteness, classical execution, transport, placeholder, option, or
  lint-suppression token.
- **Outcome / next action:** the explicit checker design survives; the
  proof-only `Fintype` route and a premature Add-Edges constructor are rejected.
  No ordered construction, maximal-removal, minimal-kept, or confluence claim
  follows. The planned order-sensitive two-observation constructor fixture was
  deliberately not completed, so those questions remain a separate gate only
  if an independent consumer demands an automatic pruning pass. Keep EXP-107's
  graph semantics and EXP-109's checker experimental; rotate delivery to the
  general probability, history, and long-run interfaces meanwhile.

### EXP-110: opt-in countable discrete probability

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-16, implementation at `5be6d923`
- **Status:** complete; supports an opt-in countable layer; no public API adopted
- **Decision / question:** whether a small direct-`PMF` layer can support
  countably supported stochastic objects while `FinDist` remains the canonical
  finite-support law and its representation remains private.
- **Representative slice:** a constant-half discrete hazard whose first-stop
  law lives on `Option ℕ`, has positive mass at every finite stopping date, and
  therefore cannot be a `FinDist`; prove its point masses and one bounded
  expectation decomposition. Reuse Mathlib `PMF` directly and include only an
  explicit `FinDist.toPMF` boundary where a finite law enters the countable
  layer.
- **Competing designs:** replace finite semantics with `PMF`; add an opt-in
  countable discrete module; or create a new probability wrapper. Prefer the
  opt-in direct-`PMF` module. Preserve `FinDist` for finite executable algebra
  and reject a third abstraction.
- **Measurements:** required summability/boundedness premises; authored PMF and
  `toPMF` surface; whether the stopping law has provably infinite support;
  focused build; and downstream imports added to stable finite modules.
- **Kill conditions:** a coercion from `FinDist` to `PMF`, PMF fields added to
  existing finite game syntax solely for compatibility, hidden
  summability/integrability obligations, a duplicate expectation API, or an
  allegedly countable layer that only works because the carrier is finite.
- **Observations:**
  [`CountableDiscreteStopping.lean`](../GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/CountableDiscreteStopping.lean)
  is a 133-line direct Mathlib `PMF` consumer. The constant-half first-stop law
  on `Option ℕ` has mass `2⁻⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾` at every `some n`, zero mass at `none`, and
  infinite support; consequently no `FinDist` has the same underlying PMF.
  `lake build GameTheory.Experimental.PostArchitecture.CountableDiscreteStopping`
  passed 2,492 jobs warning-free. No stable finite module imports the
  experiment, and source audits found no coercion, classical execution,
  transport, placeholder, option, or lint-suppression token.
  The phase-2 boundary audit counts 19 representation tokens and 1 `toPMF`
  token in this file; the three-file countable/infinite-path boundary is
  reported separately from the stable zero-leak bucket.
- **Outcome / next action:** the direct-`PMF` design survives, and replacing
  `FinDist` or adding a third probability wrapper is rejected. EXP-112
  validates the bounded analytic bridge; require an infinite-play payoff
  consumer before deciding whether any stable countable stochastic surface is
  earned.

### EXP-111: realizable stochastic public histories

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-16, `main` at `5be6d923`
- **Status:** complete hostile result; experiment-only; no public API adopted
- **Decision / question:** whether the proof-free stochastic `PublicHistory`
  should expose realizability as the image of canonical protocol traces, and
  whether profile agreement on that image suffices for canonical runner and
  finite-average-payoff congruence.
- **Representative slice:** the existing action-dependent stochastic
  continuation fixture. Compare profiles that differ only at a forged
  one-stage record whose target has zero transition support, then compare a
  nearby pair differing at the actually realized first record.
- **Competing designs:** a transparent image predicate over canonical traces;
  a bundled coherent-history carrier; or a second recursive stochastic
  reachability/runner. Prefer the transparent predicate and reuse protocol
  execution. Reject a new carrier or evaluator unless the hostile slice proves
  the current representation inadequate.
- **Measurements:** theorem assumptions, reuse of `runBehavioralFrom_congr`,
  duplicate induction count, focused build, and whether transition support—not
  merely source-state matching—rejects the forged record.
- **Kill conditions:** a second runner, a coherence predicate weaker than
  canonical trace realization, a profile-agreement certificate that cannot
  survive same-player updates, or a payoff congruence proved from duplicated
  semantics instead of the canonical run law.
- **Observations:**
  [`StochasticPublicHistoryCoherence.lean`](../GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/StochasticPublicHistoryCoherence.lean)
  is a 262-line specialization of the canonical protocol runner. It defines
  realizability as an exact trace image and agreement on that image, proves
  reflexivity/symmetry/transitivity and same-replacement preservation, then
  reuses `runBehavioralFrom_congr` for runner, public-history-law, and
  finite-average-payoff equality. In the independent continuation fixture, a
  record with the correct source/action but a zero-support target is formally
  unrealizable; changing policy only there preserves every finite-horizon law
  and payoff.
  [`StochasticPublicHistoryCoherenceTest.lean`](../GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/StochasticPublicHistoryCoherenceTest.lean)
  closes the nearby rejection in 114 lines: the empty history is canonically
  realizable, the live policy fails agreement there, its one-step public law
  differs from the canonical law, and player `false`'s one-step finite-average
  payoff changes from `0` to `1`.
  `lake build GameTheory.Experimental.PostArchitecture.StochasticPublicHistoryCoherence`
  passed 1,736 jobs warning-free; the focused hostile-test build passed 1,737
  jobs warning-free. Source audits found no second runner, duplicated execution
  induction, transport, placeholder, option, or lint-suppression token.
- **Outcome / next action:** the transparent canonical-image design survives
  and a bundled history carrier is rejected. Keep it experimental until a
  second independent domain consumer shows that a stable public-history
  agreement API materially reduces downstream bridge work; the required
  forged/live polarity is no longer open.

### EXP-112: bounded expectation for countable PMFs

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-16, implementation at `64cec476`
- **Status:** complete experiment-only result; no public API adopted
- **Decision / question:** whether the direct countable `PMF` layer can expose
  real-valued bounded expectation with explicit totality hypotheses and agree
  exactly with canonical `FinDist.expect` on finite-support laws.
- **Representative slice:** reuse EXP-110's geometric first-stop law on
  `Option ℕ`; compute the expectation of at least one nonconstant bounded
  observable, then prove preservation for `FinDist.toPMF` without exposing the
  finite representation elsewhere.
- **Competing designs:** use Mathlib's PMF/measure integral directly; define a
  theorem-local absolutely summable series; or duplicate the finite
  `FinDist.expect` API. Prefer the existing Mathlib analytic notion if it has
  the required laws. Reject a duplicate probability or expectation wrapper.
- **Measurements:** summability/integrability premises, ENNReal-to-real surface,
  finite-law preservation proof size, reusable map/bind laws, and imports
  pulled into the experiment.
- **Kill conditions:** an unconditional real expectation for unbounded
  countable observables, hidden convergence, a coercion-based FinDist bridge,
  duplicated map/bind semantics, or promotion before the geometric consumer
  and finite-law preservation both compile.
- **Observations:**
  [`CountablePMFExpectation.lean`](../GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/CountablePMFExpectation.lean)
  is a 96-line direct Mathlib integration slice. For a countable discrete
  measurable carrier and a pointwise norm bound, it rewrites the Bochner
  integral against `PMF.toMeasure` as the explicit probability-weighted
  `tsum`. The same theorem specializes exactly to `FinDist.expect` through the
  explicit `toPMF` boundary. On EXP-110's non-finitely-supported stopping law,
  the nonconstant bounded observable `none ↦ 0`, `some n ↦ 2⁻ⁿ` has integral
  `2 / 3`. Integrability is discharged explicitly with
  `Integrable.of_bound`; no unconditional unbounded expectation is stated.
  `lake build GameTheory.Experimental.PostArchitecture.CountablePMFExpectation`
  passed 2,509 jobs warning-free. Source audits found no duplicate expectation
  wrapper, coercion, hidden convergence premise, transport, placeholder,
  option, or lint suppression.
  The phase-2 boundary audit counts 7 representation tokens and 2 `toPMF`
  tokens in this file; its representation use remains confined to the
  explicitly measured experiment boundary.
- **Outcome / next action:** Mathlib's Bochner integral is the surviving
  countable expectation design; a new expectation wrapper is rejected. The
  EXP-108 measured two-point payoff consumer now uses the explicit
  `FinDist.toPMF.toMeasure` boundary. Keep the bridge experimental until a
  canonical game-path payoff consumer needs it, then decide whether the minimal
  PMF/FinDist preservation theorem belongs in a stable opt-in interop module.

### EXP-113: canonical stochastic game-path asymptotic payoff

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-17, implementation on the post-EXP-112 working tree
- **Status:** complete experiment-only result; no public API adopted
- **Decision / question:** can the EXP-108 infinite canonical path measure and
  asymptotic payoff signatures consume a genuinely nonconstant stochastic game
  path without adding a second runner or an expectation/limit interchange?
- **Representative slice:** one-player Boolean-state game with a fair initial
  transition and absorbing Boolean states; use the canonical infinite path law
  and a bounded path payoff selected by its first realized transition.
- **Competing designs:** consume the canonical path coordinates directly, add a
  second recursive path evaluator, or leave game-path payoffs unconnected.
  Reject the second evaluator and any unproved interchange.
- **Measurements:** exact canonical finite-marginal projection, pathwise
  liminf/limsup and finite-average-limit values, explicit bounded-integrability
  hypotheses, and focused warning-free build.
- **Kill conditions:** duplicate running semantics, constant/trivial game law,
  hidden measurability or integrability, expectation/limit interchange, or
  coercion between terminal, limiting-average, and uniform concepts.
- **Evidence / outcome:** `ProtocolHistoryCountable.lean` derives countability
  of canonical histories from finite players and countable state/action
  carriers, without requiring a finite state space.
  `StochasticInfinitePlayCoherence.lean` compiles a
  support-preserving one-step path theorem and its countable all-stage
  almost-everywhere form. It also derives an almost-everywhere exact
  `History.extend` witness for every adjacent pair, using the existing
  `Kernel.traj`/`partialTraj` APIs. Validation:
  `lake env lean GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/StochasticInfinitePlayCoherence.lean`.
  `StochasticInfinitePlayPayoffBridge.lean` defines the canonical stage/path
  averages and transports their integrals to existing finite-horizon laws.
  `StochasticInfinitePlayPayoffConsistency.lean` now compiles the bounded
  finite-horizon pathwise stagewise-consistency and integral bridge, validated
  with `lake build
  GameTheory.Experimental.PostArchitecture.StochasticInfinitePlayPayoffConsistency`.
  `StochasticGamePathPayoff.lean` supplies the genuinely nonconstant
  one-player `Option Bool` consumer with an explicit axiom-free countable
  canonical-history instance, positive fair branches, canonical behavioral
  joint-action reduction, exact `finiteAveragePayoff` horizon-2 value `1/4`,
  and the canonical path integral at horizon 2 equal to `1/4`. The same
  integral is transported to `expectedFiniteAverage` at index 1 through
  `pathwiseAverage_canonicalStageUtility`. Almost-everywhere path coherence
  then yields the exact formula `n / (n + 1) * (1 / 2)` for every expected
  finite average, convergence to `1/2`, and expected pathwise liminf and
  limsup both equal to `1/2`. The latter two use almost-everywhere convergence
  of each pathwise average to its selected bit; no expectation/limit
  interchange occurs. A public extension-stage lemma removes the dependent
  chronological-index transport that blocked the first proof attempt.
  `lake build
  GameTheory.Experimental.PostArchitecture.StochasticGamePathPayoff` passed
  3,021 jobs warning-free. Source, width, and diff audits are clean.
- **Outcome / next action:** the canonical finite-marginal infinite-play law
  and all three deliberately separate long-run payoff orders survive a
  nonconstant canonical game consumer. Keep them experiment-only: the direct
  PMF/measure crossing remains an explicitly measured boundary and has only
  one domain consumer. The next stochastic gate is EXP-114's cyclic all-phase
  uniformity and its hostile off-phase deviation, not an automatic coercion
  among terminal, limiting-average, and uniform equilibrium.

### EXP-114: cyclic all-phase uniform equilibrium

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-17, reservation on the EXP-113 working tree
- **Status:** in progress; experiment-only; no public API adopted
- **Decision / question:** can stochastic uniform equilibrium quantify every
  canonical restart phase without importing the well-founded terminal SPE
  interface or coercing between terminal, limiting-average, and uniform
  equilibrium notions?
- **Representative slice:** define all-phase uniform epsilon equilibrium by
  applying the existing finite-horizon uniform predicate to canonical
  `afterPublicHistory` continuations, prove that it implies initial-phase
  uniformity, and test a two-phase cyclic quitting game whose initial phase is
  credible while another phase admits a profitable deviation.
- **Competing designs:** quantify canonical finite histories and reuse restart
  semantics; reuse well-founded Protocol subgames; or add a cyclic runner.
  Reject the latter two because the game is cyclic and the canonical stochastic
  runner/restart calculus already exists.
- **Measurements:** quantifier and assumption surface, runner reuse, exact
  hostile positive/negative controls, focused build, and source hazards.
- **Kill conditions:** a second runner, terminal/SPE coercion, inference from
  only the chosen initial phase, hidden infinite-path assumptions, or a bundled
  hierarchy before the hostile consumer compiles.
- **Evidence / outcome:** `CyclicUniformInterface.lean` currently compiles the
  transparent all-phase predicate, its initial-phase consequence, and a cyclic
  unit-action positive control over the existing `afterPublicHistory`
  semantics. This is provisional evidence only. The attempted two-phase
  quitting control exposed a public canonical-runner gap: after a unilateral
  profile update, `stageRecordOfEvent_joint` provides an existentially erased
  stage record but no rewrite that preserves the joint action in the
  transition-support term. Proving that the unchanged opponent action keeps
  the initial phase absorbing would therefore require private `jointAction`
  plumbing or visible transports. The broken fixture was deleted. The next
  action is a general public event/transition congruence seam, followed by the
  same hostile test; do not adopt the all-phase interface before it passes.

### EXP-115: horizon-relative Kuhn realization

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-20, reservation on the current working tree
- **Status:** complete; supports stable bounded realization
- **Decision / question:** whether the behavioral-to-mixed Kuhn direction can
  construct a finite-support mixed witness from the finite support actually
  exposed by one bounded behavioral run, while `BehavioralPolicy.toMixed`
  remains the finite full-product convenience.
- **Representative slice:** an acts-once protocol with an infinite ambient
  information-state carrier and a bounded behavioral profile that reaches more
  than one information state with positive probability.
- **Competing designs:** retain ambient `Fintype InfoState`; construct a
  horizon/profile-relative mixed witness over the finite support tree; or widen
  `MixedPolicy` beyond `FinDist`. Prefer the relative witness and keep the
  canonical finite law unchanged.
- **Measurements:** public assumptions; second-runner or duplicated-semantics
  count; transport/update hazards; focused builds; and whether EFG/FOSG
  whole-profile laws generalize without weakening unilateral/Nash contracts.
- **Kill conditions:** a second evaluator, direct `Function.update`, visible
  transport in Protocol/language code, a hidden global finiteness assumption,
  changing `MixedPolicy`, or claiming finiteness-free unilateral/Nash transfer
  without a counterfactual predrawability certificate.
- **Artifacts / commands:** `GameTheory/Math/Probability/FinDist.lean`;
  `GameTheory/Protocol/Information.lean`;
  `GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/KuhnFiniteSupport.lean`;
  `GameTheory/Languages/{EFG,FOSG}/Kuhn.lean`;
  `lake build GameTheory.Protocol.Strategic GameTheory.Languages.EFG.Kuhn
  GameTheory.Languages.FOSG.Kuhn
  GameTheory.Experimental.PostArchitecture.KuhnFiniteSupport
  GameTheory.Tests.EFGKuhn GameTheory.Tests.EFGKuhnNash
  GameTheory.Experimental.PostArchitecture.FOSGKuhn` (1,735 jobs).
- **Observations / measurements:** `Nat` is the hostile information carrier,
  and the two-round behavioral support reaches both decision states `0` and
  `1`. A finite dependent product over the support sites realizes its complete
  history law. The Protocol, EFG, and FOSG bounded whole-profile theorems now
  require no `Fintype` or `DecidableEq` on information states. The change adds
  no runner or probability carrier; the focused build is warning-clean, and
  added-source scans find no placeholder, raw update, visible transport,
  `Fintype.ofFinite`, `open Classical`, or custom axiom.
- **Outcome / next action:** promote the finite-site `toMixedOn` operation and
  the profile/horizon-local existential realization theorem. Keep
  `BehavioralPolicy.toMixed` as the finite full-product convenience. Keep the
  exact updated-law and Nash-transfer surfaces finite until a separately
  validated counterfactual predrawability certificate justifies weakening
  them.

### EXP-116: bounded stochastic Kuhn under counterfactual site coverage

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-20, reservation after `a2f09b63`
- **Status:** complete; supports the stable bounded API
- **Decision / question:** whether a finite family of information sites that
  covers every legal prefix through one horizon is the right operation-local
  premise for fixed mixed witnesses, unilateral updated laws, and Nash
  transfer when the ambient information carrier is infinite.
- **Representative slice:** a finite-action perfect-monitoring stochastic game
  where a unilateral deviation reaches a positive-support public history that
  the baseline behavioral profile never reaches.
- **Competing designs:** retain global `Fintype InfoState`; add a generic
  Protocol counterfactual-site certificate consumed by a thin stochastic
  specialization; or prove a stochastic-only duplicate of Kuhn. Prefer the
  generic certificate and theorem with stochastic ownership limited to recall,
  finite coverage, and transparent corollaries.
- **Measurements:** public assumptions; whether one mixed baseline works
  against every deviation; new semantic/evaluator count; proof and import
  cost; focused builds; source hazards; and whether the stochastic theorem
  needs finite states or only finite branching through the selected horizon.
- **Kill conditions:** an omitted off-path history changes an updated law;
  global `Fintype PublicHistory`; a second runner or equilibrium predicate;
  stored finiteness; direct `Function.update`; visible transport; or a
  stochastic theorem whose proof does not factor through the canonical
  Protocol runner.
- **Artifacts / commands:** `GameTheory/Math/Probability/FinDist.lean`;
  `GameTheory/Protocol/{Information,Strategic}.lean`;
  `GameTheory/Stochastic/{History,Kuhn}.lean`;
  `GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/StochasticKuhn.lean`;
  `lake build GameTheory.Protocol.Strategic GameTheory.Stochastic.Kuhn
  GameTheory.Experimental.PostArchitecture.StochasticKuhn GameTheory.Stochastic`;
  full `lake build` (3,990 jobs).
- **Observations / measurements:** `CoversInformationSites` is independent of
  the selected profile and is therefore stable under unilateral updates.
  Perfect monitoring proves perfect recall directly from public-history own
  play. A locally uniform finite-action profile assigns positive mass to every
  legal choice, so its bounded support sites cover every legal prefix. The
  resulting public whole-profile, unilateral, and expected-utility Nash laws
  require finite players and actions, but neither finite states nor
  `Fintype PublicHistory`. The hostile Boolean game proves its list-history
  carrier infinite, excludes action `true` from the baseline's initial
  support, proves the resulting one-step information state is nevertheless in
  the common bounded cover, and consumes both unilateral and Nash transfer.
  No new runner, equilibrium predicate, or probability carrier was added.
- **Outcome / next action:** promote finite counterfactual coverage,
  `BehavioralPolicy.toMixedWithin`, the generic bounded unilateral laws, and
  the thin stochastic public-policy corollaries. Retain the global
  `BehavioralPolicy.toMixed` finiteness requirement. Gate infinite-horizon
  Kuhn separately on a regular probability measure over policy products and
  finite-prefix marginal/deviation laws; a `FinDist` witness is not expected.

### EXP-117: infinite regular-probability Kuhn

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-20, reservation after `808e2fda`
- **Status:** complete; supports D57 and the promoted stable API
- **Decision / question:** whether Mathlib's infinite product probability
  measure can provide one ex-ante law over total pure policies whose every
  finite-coordinate marginal is the existing finite predraw, whose induced
  finite-prefix laws agree with behavioral play before and after unilateral
  deviations, and whose discounted expected payoff therefore agrees.
- **Representative slice:** a finite-action perfect-monitoring stochastic game
  with countably infinite public histories, an off-baseline unilateral branch,
  and a bounded nonconstant discounted stage utility.
- **Competing designs:** misuse a horizon-indexed family of `FinDist` witnesses;
  reuse the behavioral infinite-path measure; add a regular product measure
  over pure-policy coordinates at Protocol and expose thin stochastic
  corollaries; or introduce a new universal probability abstraction. Prefer
  the product measure with direct `Measure` statements and no new abstraction.
- **Measurements:** exact finite marginals; regularity/countability assumptions;
  one-law-for-all-horizons quantifier order; unilateral coordinate stability;
  discounted sum interchange; runner reuse; source hazards; and focused/full
  builds.
- **Kill conditions:** one witness per horizon rather than one measure; a path
  law presented as a policy law; loss of arbitrary unilateral deviations; a
  second runner or equilibrium predicate; hidden global finiteness; custom
  probability abstraction; placeholder; visible transport; or discounted
  equality asserted without boundedness/summability hypotheses.
- **Artifacts / commands:** `GameTheory/Math/Probability/Measure.lean`;
  `GameTheory/Protocol/PolicyMeasure.lean`;
  `GameTheory/Stochastic/Kuhn.lean`;
  `GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/StochasticInfiniteKuhn.lean`;
  focused builds of the math bridge (2,990 jobs), Protocol layer (3,001 jobs),
  stochastic specialization (3,018 jobs), and hostile consumer (3,020 jobs).
  The integrated Math/Protocol/Stochastic/hostile target passed 3,048 jobs;
  the full default target passed all 3,995 jobs. Deep Phase 2 and Phase 3
  architecture/reachability audits both reported `VERIFIED=1`.
- **Observations / measurements:** `behavioralProfileMeasure` is selected
  before the horizon quantifier and is an ordinary probability measure over
  total pure Protocol policies. Mapping it to any finite site family is exactly
  the existing nested `FinDist.pi` predraw. Covered execution factors through
  that restriction and the sole Protocol runner, giving all finite-prefix
  laws. The same theorem consumes an arbitrary behavioral unilateral
  replacement. Regularity is inferred only under countable indices and the
  standard Borel, second-countable, completely-pseudometrizable factor
  hypotheses; the perfect-monitoring stochastic corollary discharges these
  for finite actions and countable states. Discounted equality assumes
  summability generically and derives it from a uniform stage bound with
  `0 ≤ discount < 1` in the stochastic layer. The hostile Boolean game has
  countably infinite public histories, an off-baseline deviation, and
  action-dependent utilities `0` and `1`. Source audits report zero forbidden
  transports, raw updates, `Fintype.ofFinite`, placeholders, or custom axioms;
  all eight flagship axiom prints use only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and
  `Quot.sound`. Stable Protocol and Stochastic roots positively reach the new
  policy-law declarations while rejecting the experimental path measure.
- **Outcome / next action:** support and adopt D57. Promote the narrow
  `FinDist.toMeasure` bridge, the Protocol infinite-product policy law with
  finite marginals/all-prefix/unilateral/discounted consequences, and thin
  stochastic corollaries. No kill condition fired. Keep the unbounded
  `FinDist` convenience finite. A reverse theorem conditionalizing an
  arbitrary regular pure-policy law into behavior, and any infinite-path
  outcome semantics, require separate consumers and gates.

### EXP-118: reverse infinite regular-probability Kuhn

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-20, reservation after `fd6d19b0`
- **Status:** complete; supports D58 and the promoted stable API
- **Decision / question:** whether a profile of independent ordinary
  probability measures over total pure policies has one behavioral reading
  that preserves every finite-prefix law under perfect recall, including
  arbitrary unilateral replacement measures and bounded discounted payoff.
- **Representative slice:** countably infinite perfect-monitoring public
  histories with a single player's pure-policy measure correlating its actions
  across information states, a positive-probability own-record conditioning
  event, a zero-probability off-path fallback, and a unilateral replacement
  measure that is not the forward independent-coordinate construction.
- **Competing designs:** require a regular conditional-probability kernel over
  the entire policy space; condition directly on the finite own-record
  cylinders used by perfect recall; reduce separately at each horizon without
  producing one behavioral object; or accept an arbitrary correlated joint
  player-profile law. Prefer finite-cylinder conditioning of independent
  per-player policy measures. A correlated joint player law has no behavioral
  profile representation without an additional public correlating device.
- **Measurements:** exact conversion of finite discrete probability measures
  to `FinDist`; measurability of own-record and answer cylinders; equality with
  the existing finite-support behavioral reading; one behavioral object before
  the horizon quantifier; arbitrary unilateral replacement; discounted
  summability; regularity assumptions actually used; runner reuse; source
  hazards; focused/full builds; and axiom profile.
- **Kill conditions:** silently treating a correlated joint law as independent;
  a horizon-indexed behavioral witness; global information-state finiteness;
  an unnecessary disintegration/standard-Borel hypothesis when finite
  cylinders suffice; a second runner or equilibrium predicate; loss of
  arbitrary unilateral replacement measures; a moving off-path fallback;
  placeholder; visible transport; or discounted equality without convergence
  hypotheses.
- **Observations / measurements:** finite discrete probability measures convert
  to `FinDist` and back exactly. `ConsistentAt` is a measurable finite cylinder,
  so the behavioral reading uses ordinary finite-event conditioning and needs
  neither disintegration nor regular conditional probabilities. The reading
  agrees definitionally at the law level with the existing finite-support
  conditional construction. Closing any finite prefix cover under the finitely
  many own-record coordinates reduces arbitrary policy measures to the existing
  mixed runner, while the resulting behavioral object remains outside the
  horizon quantifier. The generic theorem accepts every probability measure;
  regularity is therefore sufficient but not necessary. Arbitrary correlated
  joint player-profile laws remain excluded because ordinary behavioral
  profiles provide no public correlation device.
- **Artifacts / commands:** `GameTheory/Math/Probability/Measure.lean` owns the
  finite-discrete and conditioning bridge;
  `GameTheory/Protocol/PolicyMeasure.lean` owns own-record conditioning,
  all-prefix, unilateral-replacement, and discounted laws;
  `GameTheory/Stochastic/Kuhn.lean` provides thin perfect-monitoring corollaries;
  `GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/StochasticReverseInfiniteKuhn.lean`
  pushes an infinite product law through a measurable transformation forcing
  two policy coordinates to agree while retaining all other coordinates, and
  consumes all-prefix, unilateral, and discounted theorems. Focused builds
  compiled 2,990, 3,001, 3,018, and 3,021 jobs for the measure bridge,
  Protocol layer, stochastic specialization, and hostile consumer. The full
  library build passed 3,996 jobs. Standard and deep Phase 2 and Phase 3 audits
  all reported `VERIFIED=1`; the roots reached all 14 stochastic and all eight
  Protocol policy-measure probes while rejecting the experimental path
  measure. Ten representative axiom prints use only `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- **Outcome / next action:** support and adopt D58. Promote the reverse
  arbitrary-policy-measure layer at Protocol and its thin stochastic
  specialization. No kill condition fired. Keep general correlated joint
  player laws and infinite-path outcome semantics outside this API.

### EXP-119: hybrid unilateral infinite-policy Kuhn

- **Date / revision:** 2026-08-20, reservation after `e6cdb3ad`
- **Status:** complete; supports D59 and the promoted stable API
- **Decision / question:** whether the forward and reverse total-policy-law
  constructions preserve both heterogeneous unilateral deviation forms:
  arbitrary policy-law opponents with a behavioral focal deviation, and
  behavioral opponents with an arbitrary policy-law focal deviation.
- **Representative slice:** a perfect-monitoring stochastic game on countably
  infinite public histories, using a within-policy correlated law on one side
  and an off-baseline behavioral deviation on the other.
- **Competing designs:** expose explicit hybrid run-law theorems; rely on the
  homogeneous update theorems and an implicit round trip; or introduce a new
  equilibrium predicate over measures. Prefer explicit laws derived through
  the existing bounded mixed/behavioral unilateral correspondence.
- **Measurements:** exact preservation of the focal strategy in both
  directions; opponent profile preservation; one measure/behavioral object
  before the horizon quantifier; arbitrary finite-prefix horizon; stochastic
  specialization; source hazards; focused/full builds; architecture audits;
  and axiom profile.
- **Kill conditions:** replacing the quantified focal deviation by its
  behavioral or policy-law round trip; assuming global information-state
  finiteness; weakening counterfactual coverage to baseline support; a second
  runner or equilibrium predicate; placeholder; visible transport; or an API
  that proves only homogeneous profile updates.
- **Observations / measurements:** a behavioral product law restricted to any
  finite site set converts exactly to the existing `toMixedWithin` predraw.
  Fixed-fallback finite round-trip and unilateral theorems retain the one
  horizon-independent conditional reading of arbitrary opponent laws. Record
  closure then lets both heterogeneous measure profiles factor through the
  existing bounded mixed runner while preserving the original focal object
  literally. Both all-prefix laws extend pointwise to prefix expectations and,
  under summability, normalized discounted payoffs. The two-player hostile
  game keeps a real opponent, uses a correlated within-policy law, and consumes
  both all-prefix and both bounded discounted directions.
- **Artifacts / commands:** `GameTheory/Protocol/{Information,Strategic,
  PolicyMeasure}.lean`; `GameTheory/Stochastic/Kuhn.lean`;
  `GameTheory/Experimental/PostArchitecture/StochasticHybridInfiniteKuhn.lean`;
  `docs/decisions/D59-hybrid-unilateral-infinite-kuhn.md`. Focused builds
  compiled 1,717 jobs for Information, 1,720 for Strategic, 3,001 for Protocol
  policy measures, 3,018 for stochastic Kuhn, and 3,019 for the hostile
  consumer. The full default target passed all 3,997 jobs. Standard and deep
  Phase 2 and Phase 3 audits all reported `VERIFIED=1`; stable roots reached
  all 15 Protocol policy-measure probes and all 18 stochastic probes while
  rejecting the experimental path measure. Source audits report zero raw
  updates, forbidden transports, `Fintype.ofFinite`, placeholders, or custom
  axioms. Twelve representative axiom prints use only `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- **Outcome / next action:** support and adopt D59. Promote both hybrid
  all-prefix and discounted unilateral squares at Protocol, plus thin
  perfect-monitoring stochastic corollaries. No kill condition fired. These
  laws now support transport of the Nash deviation quantifier without adding
  another equilibrium predicate. Keep correlated joint player laws and
  infinite-path outcome semantics outside this API.
