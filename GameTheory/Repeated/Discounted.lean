# Discounted repeated games

Normalized discounted payoff evaluates the deterministic stage-profile path
from `Basic`. The only infinite object is an ordinary real series; there is no
`FinDist` over infinite histories. The induced strategic form is
`UtilityGame.repeatedForm`, so discounted equilibrium is ordinary `IsNash`.
