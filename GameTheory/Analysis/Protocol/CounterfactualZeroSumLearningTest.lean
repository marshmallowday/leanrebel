# Same-trace two-player Protocol regret learning

Two Boolean players act simultaneously in the existing one-shot FOSG
Protocol.  Both run local counterfactual regret matching, and their learned
laws are assembled into one zero-sum action trace.  The payoff is separable but
not constant: both players have a strict improving action, both initial regret
contributions are positive, and both learned laws move.
