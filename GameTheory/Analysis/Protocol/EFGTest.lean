# Hostile finite EFG assessment and equilibrium test

Nature privately selects a Boolean state, then the sole player acts without
observing it. The two decision histories are distinct but produce the same
information state. This tests the EFG specialization, finite history
enumeration, history-supported beliefs, and the analytic sequential-equilibrium
presentation together. A fully mixed Bayes assessment later proves that the
presentation carries an actual sequential-equilibrium witness.
