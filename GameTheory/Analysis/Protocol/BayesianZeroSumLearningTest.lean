# Multi-site Bayesian Protocol regret learning

A common fair type creates two positive-probability information sites for each
of two players. Four coupled local regret matchers are assembled into one law
over complete contingent policies, and their shared trace is intended to feed
the static zero-sum regret-to-Nash theorem.
