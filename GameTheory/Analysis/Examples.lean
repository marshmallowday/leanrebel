# What the fixed-point argument buys

Matching pennies is the game the existence theorem exists for. It has no
equilibrium in pure strategies at all — the executable frontend decides that, and
the decision is a theorem here rather than a computation the reader is asked to
trust — and yet it has one in mixed strategies.

The contrast with the potential-game argument is the point. There, existence
came from maximizing a function and the maximizer was exhibited. Here nothing is
maximized globally and no profile is supplied: the equilibrium is produced by a
fixed point, which is why the dependency that proves fixed points exist is worth
its cost.
