# The discounted folk theorem

Feasible payoffs strictly above every opponent-minmax punishment level are
limits of normalized discounted payoff vectors of history-dependent Nash
profiles in the observable mixed-action repeated game. The statement uses
`UtilityGame.mixed`, deterministic repeated paths, discounted utility, and
ordinary `IsNash` directly. There is no repeated-equilibrium wrapper and no
probability law over an infinite path.
