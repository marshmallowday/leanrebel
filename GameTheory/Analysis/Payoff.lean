# The mixed payoff as a polynomial in the weights

Expected utility of a mixed profile is defined through composition of laws,
which is the right definition and the wrong shape for topology. Written out over
the finite profile space it is a polynomial: a sum over pure profiles of the
product of the players' weights times that profile's utility.

That rewriting is what buys continuity, and it buys one more thing that matters
as much. Exactly one factor of each product belongs to any given player, so the
payoff is *affine* in one player's weights with the others held fixed. Affine in
each coordinate separately is what makes a best-response set convex, and convex
best responses are the hypothesis a set-valued fixed-point theorem cannot do
without.
