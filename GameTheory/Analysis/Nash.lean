# Existence of a mixed equilibrium

Every finite game has an equilibrium in mixed strategies. Unlike the potential
argument, which finds one by maximizing a single function, this needs a genuine
fixed point: nothing is being maximized globally, and the object that has to
exist is a profile at which every player is simultaneously already best
replying.

The argument is the classical one. Mixed profiles form a compact convex
polytope; each player's best replies to a profile form a nonempty convex set,
nonempty because a continuous function attains its maximum on a compact set and
convex because the payoff is affine in the deviator's own weights; the whole
best-reply correspondence has a closed graph; and a fixed point of it is exactly
a profile no player wants to move away from.

This is the module the fixed-point dependency exists for, and it is the only
place a set-valued fixed-point theorem is used.

/-! ## Continuity of replacing one player's weights

Both the best-reply set and its graph are cut out by inequalities between
payoffs at updated profiles, so every closedness argument below rests on this
one map being continuous — jointly, because the graph varies the profile and the
reply together. -/
