# Finite multi-round games with imperfect monitoring

This is a constructor for a common native shape, not a second sequential
semantics.  A monitoring game supplies action carriers, initial observations,
and the finite-support law of the public/private signals emitted after a joint
action.  It compiles directly to the accepted execution and information
interfaces.  Within this constructor, Protocol is therefore the sole owner of
histories, policies, run laws, and strategic-form compilation.  This claim does
not subsume `Repeated.PublicMonitoring`, whose native signal-history recursion
serves repeated-game continuation and PPE theory rather than this richer
own-action-recalling information model.

The execution state retains realized joint actions and all signals.  A player's
information state retains only that player's own previous choices and received
signals.  Thus previous-action recall and imperfect monitoring are enforced by
the target types rather than asserted as a locality condition on policies.
