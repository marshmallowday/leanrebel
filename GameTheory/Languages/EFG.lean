# Extensive forms as a transparent Protocol specialization

An extensive-form game is not given a second tree evaluator here. Its execution
and information semantics are exactly the accepted Protocol objects, together
with the two structural laws that distinguish an EFG from a general protocol:
reachable histories form a tree and at most one player moves at a state.
States with no active player are ordinary Protocol chance states.

Finiteness remains a capability of the theorem that needs it. In particular,
`Game` stores no `Fintype`; a finite state carrier plus tree-shapedness yields
an explicit history enumeration through `historyFintype`.

This syntax module imports no utility, preference, solution concept, or
Analysis module.
