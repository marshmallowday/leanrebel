# Direct-revelation mechanism syntax

A mechanism records report types, an outcome type, and the rule mapping a
report profile to an outcome.  This language module contains no utility,
preference, or solution concept.  The deterministic compiler is structural;
strategyproofness and auction theorems live in `GameTheory.Mechanism`.
