# Bayesian strategic-form transfer

The solution-concept-free Bayesian compiler identifies information-local
policies with type-contingent plans and proves equality of their outcome laws.
This leaf adds expected utility and packages those compiler facts as an
ordinary Nash equivalence.  It defines no Bayesian-specific equilibrium
predicate.
