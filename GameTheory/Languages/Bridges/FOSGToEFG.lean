# Explicit-order FOSG serialization

A simultaneous FOSG round is serialized into one hidden selection slot per
source player and one resolver step.  The target state retains the canonical
source history and certified source-local choices; it introduces no second
runner or history type.

The construction preserves source histories and source-local choices at every
serialization round. Exact public claims compare the target law after erasing
serialization-only microsteps; the un-erased EFG history contains strictly
more scheduling data. Whole-round support lands back at a clean boundary, and
the exact law and terminal-support results also hold for continuations from
any supplied reached boundary.
