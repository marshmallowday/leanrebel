# Bayesian direct-mechanism syntax and compilation

A Bayesian mechanism keeps true types separate from reports. Its utility reads
the true type profile and the chosen outcome; a misreport therefore cannot
silently change the type used to evaluate the deviator.

The compiler makes reports the actions of an ordinary `BayesianGame`.  This
module contains data and compilation only; incentive predicates and equilibrium
theorems live under `GameTheory.Mechanism`.
