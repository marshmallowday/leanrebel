# EFG strategic-form transfer

An EFG's pure strategy is an information-local contingent plan, already owned
by its `InformationModel`. The strategic form therefore applies the accepted
Protocol compiler directly; there is no EFG-specific evaluator and no
intermediate normal-form game.

The two central equivalences expose ordinary pure and mixed `IsNash` in the
native `run` and `runMixed` vocabulary. They define no language-specific
equilibrium predicate.
