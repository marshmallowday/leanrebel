# General typed, site-local MAID frontier semantics

Syntax stores neither finite-carrier capabilities nor an execution order.
Native policies are indexed by decision site and receive only that site's
observed-parent configuration. Evaluation resolves the entire current minimal
frontier by one dependent finite product. The public laws validate this
representation and its exact compiled-EFG semantics.
