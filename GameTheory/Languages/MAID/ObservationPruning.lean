# Observation pruning for typed MAIDs

A pruning chooses a smaller observed-parent set at every decision site.  The
reduced policy domain remains grouped by source owner and expands canonically
to the accepted site-local MAID policy by restricting each full observation.

This is the semantic target for later graphical requisite tests.  It does not
call a parent irrelevant merely because a graph predicate says so.  Exact law
transfer uses literal policy representation; safe equilibrium reduction uses
the stronger certificate that every omitted full deviation is weakly covered
by a reduced deviation.  Both directions are proved against the canonical
native and compiled forms.

/-- A reduced profile covers the original full deviation space when every full
owner-policy replacement is weakly dominated, for that owner, by some reduced
replacement.  This is the semantic certificate needed for safe information
removal: unlike `Represents`, it constrains deviations that are not themselves
in the image of `expandPolicy`.

The certificate is profile-local because a removed observation may be
irrelevant against one fixed collection of opposing policies and strategically
live against another.  A graphical requisite-information theorem can discharge
this condition uniformly when its stronger structural hypotheses hold. -/
