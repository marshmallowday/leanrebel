# Explicit-order typed MAID serialization

The execution state stores the resolved topological prefix; information states
expose only the current decision site and its declared observed-parent
configuration. Its complete assignment law equals the order-free native
frontier evaluator. The compiled EFG retains scheduling histories, so the
equivalence intentionally compares their image after forgetting history down
to the typed assignment.
