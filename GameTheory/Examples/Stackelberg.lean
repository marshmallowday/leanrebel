# Stackelberg commitment through the sequential layer

The leader-follower presentation is a finite `Protocol.Tree`. Its plan type
stores a leader commitment and a follower action after every possible
commitment. The underlying simultaneous game is independently presented as a
`TableGame`, so its equilibrium statement uses the canonical static `IsNash`
predicate.
