# Classic examples

Four executable games plus the downstream usability tests. Nothing here
opens an implementation namespace or mentions a transport, certificate, or
representation: the public `TableGame`, `Profile`, and solution-concept API is
all a reader needs.

Every `#guard` is a regression test that fails the build if the algorithm and
the semantics drift apart.
