# Factored-observation stochastic-game example

This small simultaneous two-bit game is deliberately utility-free: FOSG owns
execution and information, while a later consumer may attach an evaluation.
It installs neither a finite-history enumeration nor a bounded evaluator. Its
regression is the exact canonical history law of the FOSG-to-EFG serializer.
