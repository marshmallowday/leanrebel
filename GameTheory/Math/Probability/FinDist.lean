# Finite-support probability laws

`FinDist α` is a Mathlib `PMF` paired with a proof that its support is finite.
That representation is deliberately *not* part of the public contract. Downstream
modules use `pure`, `map`, `bind`, `pi`, `prob`, and `expect` together with the
lemmas below, never `toPMF`.

Finite support is a capability of a particular law, not a `Fintype` assumption
on its carrier: `expect` is an unconditional real number for an
arbitrary observable, and `FinDist Nat` is inhabited by genuinely two-point
laws.

The convexity-facing `stdSimplex` bridge lives outside this module, which stays
free of convexity and topology imports.

/-! ## Support-dependent composition

`bind` hands its continuation an outcome. Some continuations need more than
that: they need evidence that the outcome actually occurs. A law over histories
is the motivating case, since extending a history by one transition is only
meaningful for a transition that was realized.

Finite support survives, because the result is a union of finitely many finite
supports indexed by a finite support. -/

one deliberately does not import: taking that import would put convexity and
polynomial theory back into the closure of everything downstream, which is the
