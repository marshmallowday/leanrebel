# Finite-player congestion games

A congestion game gives each player a strategy whose finite resource set is
occupied, and assigns a real delay to each resource at each natural load.
Resource and strategy carriers remain unconstrained.  Finiteness enters only
at load-counting and aggregate operations, never in the semantic data.

The static presentation below deliberately reuses `GameForm`, `UtilityGame`,
`Profile.update`, expected-utility Nash, and the potential/dynamics theory in
`GameTheory.Core`.  It does not introduce a congestion-specific game or
equilibrium predicate.
