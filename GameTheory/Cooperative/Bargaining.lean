# Finite Nash bargaining

A bargaining problem is a feasible predicate on utility profiles together with
a feasible disagreement point.  It stores no finiteness, convexity,
compactness, topology, or existence assumption.  The Nash product needs a
finite player enumeration, so that capability appears only on its predicate
and theorems.
