# Balanced coalitional games

A balanced collection assigns nonnegative weights to coalitions so that every
agent is covered with total weight one.  Any core allocation certifies that
the game is balanced by finite double counting.  This is the easy direction
of Bondareva--Shapley; the converse requires a separate finite-dimensional
duality argument and is not claimed here.
