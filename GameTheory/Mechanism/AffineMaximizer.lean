# Affine maximizers

An affine maximizer chooses an alternative maximizing positively weighted
reported welfare plus an alternative bias, then charges Clarke externality
payments.  Its output is the canonical capability-free quasilinear direct
mechanism, whose DSIC predicate uses the library's ordinary dominant-strategy
surface.
