# Quasilinear direct mechanisms

This capability-free owner exposes the allocation and payment structure needed
by weak monotonicity, affine maximizers, and Myerson-style consumers.  It
compiles to the canonical Bayesian direct-mechanism language, so DSIC remains
the library's ordinary dominant-strategy predicate rather than a parallel
solution concept.
