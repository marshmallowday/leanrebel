# Finite-bidder sealed-bid auctions

This module is an opt-in coordinated domain layer over the canonical game-form
and response concepts.  Its generic constructor records allocation and payment
data explicitly.  The concrete second-price specialization is instead a
payoff-only strict-winner presentation, so ties give every bidder zero and it
makes no allocation or revenue claim.  The concrete first-price specialization
faithfully uses an arbitrary maximal-bid tie breaker.
