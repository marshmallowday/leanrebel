# Executable knapsack approximation frontend

Items are supplied explicitly, individually infeasible items are removed,
density order is computed without division, and the result is an actual
finite-set allocation chosen between the greedy prefix and a feasible
singleton. Correctness and the approximation ratio live in a separate leaf.
