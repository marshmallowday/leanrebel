# Groves mechanisms

The mechanism data is capability-free. Finite social-welfare aggregation and
report-independence certificates are required only by the truthfulness
theorems. For every true-type profile, the mechanism induces one deterministic
`UtilityGame`; ex-post equilibrium is ordinary Nash in that game.
