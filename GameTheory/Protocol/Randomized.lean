# Randomizing along the history

A `HistoryChooser` commits to one joint action at each history. A player that
randomizes locally does not: it draws from a law over its own options, and the
draws it makes at different histories are independent of one another. This
module runs a protocol under a chooser that answers each history with a *law*
over legal joint actions.

Two laws are composed at every step, and they are composed in the order play
happens: first the draw, then the transition it induces. The deterministic
runner is the special case in which every answer is a point mass, and that is a
theorem here rather than a convention — so this is not a third notion of play
sitting beside the other two.
