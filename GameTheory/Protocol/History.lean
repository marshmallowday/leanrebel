# Running a game along its history

`runFor` asks for a joint action given the *state*. A player choosing from what
it has seen has no such argument available: what it can condition on is the
history, and two histories can reach one state while differing in what some
player observed. A profile of such players therefore cannot drive `runFor` at
all.

This module runs the protocol along histories instead, and the central fact is
that doing so does not create a second semantics. Pushing the history law
forward along the state each history reached returns the state law exactly,
whenever the chooser is one that ignores the history. The two runners agree
wherever both are defined, so the history runner refines the state runner rather
than competing with it.

Extending a history demands evidence that the transition was realized, which is
why the recursion composes laws with a support-dependent bind: the continuation
reads the proof that its input occurs.

/-! ## External values on realized histories

A protocol describes legal execution and chance, not what a transition is
worth to a particular consumer.  Cumulative values therefore take the
transition valuation as an argument.  This keeps rewards, costs, and
application-specific utilities out of the shared execution object while still
giving every sequential language the same checked fold over realized traces.
