# Assessments, contexts, and one-shot deviations

An open game bundles three separable things, which are worth different amounts:

* the *context* — a component together with a continuation — is the idea worth
  taking, because quantifying over the continuation is exactly what upgrades a
  static equilibrium to a sequential one;
* an equilibrium predicate carried as *data* would force each constructor to
  hand-write its own optimality condition, giving one duplicate solution concept
  per constructor, so optimality is derived here instead;
* a contravariant co-outcome channel has no consumer here, so there is none.

So `Context` below is the open-game context with the co-outcome channel dropped
and the equilibrium *derived* rather than stored. It has exactly two fields: what
each of the deviator's choices leads to, and what the rest of the game is worth.
`IsLocallyOptimal` is then a definition over those fields, not a field.

The point of keeping the interface this small is that it is what a one-shot
deviation actually consumes. A one-shot deviation changes one player's call at
one information state and leaves everything else alone; `Context` is precisely
the data that change is evaluated against.

The state-indexed principle in `Backward` is deliberately not reused here:
information-local policies are run on histories, and a finite horizon supplies
the induction measure directly. A one-shot change replaces one typed choice at
the current information state, takes exactly one protocol step, and then
returns to the original profile. -/
