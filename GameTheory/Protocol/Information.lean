# Information models

The information layer. `GameTheory.Protocol.Execution` owns transitions;
this module owns *who sees what*. It never redefines a transition: every
observation is emitted by a `StepEvent`, which is exactly the data of one
realized legal step, and the initial views are the only other source.

A strategy must not be able to see hidden execution state at an information
set, and locality must not rest on a proposition proved after the fact. Three
design choices secure that.

* **Locality is typing, not a law.** `Policy` is a function of `InfoState`
  alone. Two histories carrying the same information state therefore receive the
  same answer by `congrArg`, with no constancy hypothesis to assume and no state
  argument a proof could vary. There is deliberately no `Policy` field, lemma,
  or constructor taking `E.State`.
* **The menu is information-local; adequacy is the law.** A policy chooses from
  `menu i info`, a value determined by the information state. The model's
  `menu_adequate` field then *proves* that this menu is the protocol's legal
  option set at every history producing that information state. The direction is
  the point: the menu is not computed from a hidden state and afterwards
  asserted to be local. `menu` therefore also decides *whether* a player moves,
  which is why it ranges over `Option (E.Action i)` — a player who cannot tell
  whose turn it is could not act at all.
  Adequacy ranges over terminal histories too.  Although execution never asks
  for an action after stopping, terminal activity still determines
  `LegalOption`; histories sharing an information state must therefore agree on
  that activity/menu shape, including terminal histories.
* **Beliefs may see states; policies may not.** `InfoSet` and `BeliefOn` are
  analyst-level and mention `E.State` freely, and
  `legalOption_of_mem_menu` transports the one information-local menu to every
  state a belief considers possible. So conditional reasoning at an information
  set needs no second, state-indexed menu — and no native information
  equivalence on states.

Two smaller decisions are worth recording.

`LegalOption` names the single-player conjunct of `IsLegalJoint`, so that the
information layer can speak about one player without quantifying over a joint
action. `IsLegalJoint` is its pointwise conjunction, but only propositionally:
both sides are a `match` stuck on the same discriminant, and two distinct
stuck matchers are not definitionally equal, so
`isLegalJoint_iff_legalOption` does the case split once and the rest of the
module goes through `legal_of_legalOption`.

The information state accumulates along a `Trace`, not over states. An
information set is a set of *histories* a player cannot tell apart; indexing it
by states instead would presuppose that a state summarizes everything a player
remembers.  That is a history-sufficiency or Markov property, distinct from
perfect recall: perfect recall constrains how a player's information evolves
across its own earlier observations and actions.

The signal fields and the menu law are split into two structures because the
adequacy law must mention `infoOf`, and `infoOf` is a recursion over the signal
fields. `InformationModel extends InfoSignals` keeps that a private detail:
`M.InfoState`, `M.pushInfo`, and `M.infoOf` all resolve through the parent.

for all, while a player randomizing locally draws again. The predicate below

/-! ### What a run can consult

A profile is consulted at every player and every history the run passes
through, but where a player is inactive its menu is the single option `none`, so
only the information states at which it *acts* can affect anything. The theorem
below is the corresponding congruence: agreeing where the run can reach is
enough, and behaviour elsewhere is unobservable rather than merely unused. -/

through induce the same law. -/

/-! ### Acting twice, and what forbids it

`ActsOnceAtEachInfoState` is stated as a list being duplicate-free. The two
facts below turn that into the form an argument uses: a player's record of where
it has acted only grows along play, and so an information state it has already
acted at never comes back. -/

/-- **No player is asked twice at one information state where the choice
matters.** A repeat is harmless when the menu there holds a single option:
there is nothing to draw, so drawing again cannot differ from drawing once.

The condition is stated over the menu rather than over the action carrier,
which is both the semantically right site and strictly finer — an information
state can offer a rich set of actions and still leave the player one legal
option. -/

/-! ## Randomizing

There are two places a player can put its randomness: at each information state
separately, or once over whole policies. Both are built from the same `Choice`,
so neither can name an illegal action, and both agree with a deterministic
policy when every law is a point mass.

Whether the two agree with *each other* is a different question, and it turns on
whether play can return a player to an information state it has already acted
at. A behavioral policy draws afresh on the second visit; a mixed policy is
committed by its single draw. -/

/-- Local randomization: one law over its own menu at each information state.
This is transparent for the same reason as `Policy`: coordinatewise product
constructions should inherit the canonical dependent-function API. -/

/-! ### Reading a single draw back as local randomization

A mixed policy answers an information state once, so the local law it induces
there is the law of that answer *given* that the draw could have brought play to
that information state. The condition is a statement about the player's own
record, and recall is what makes that record a function of the information state
rather than of a particular history in it. -/

own past moves, or how many times it repeated one, still constrains its policy
identically — so it fails recall and satisfies this. -/

draw, and the rest is re-read as a mixed profile that has committed there. The
commitment is then invisible, because the coordinate is never consulted again —

/-! ## When a single draw is local randomization

Reading a mixed profile back as a behavioral one preserves the law it induces,
provided every player recalls its own play. The induction follows play: at each
step the single draw is disintegrated along the joint action it prescribes, the
observed part matches the behavioral draw exactly, and the remainder is the
profile conditioned on having answered that way. What is conditioned stays
conditioned, and the tower property makes the accumulated conditioning invisible
to the behavioral reading. -/

/-- Where every drawn policy could already have brought play here, the
behavioral reading is the plain marginal. -/
