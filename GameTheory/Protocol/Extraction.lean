# Reachable decision sites and strategy extraction

`Tree.PureStrategy` is defined by recursion on the tree, so a finite-first plan
is indexed by the tree's *own* decision sites. The general-state `Chooser`, by
contrast, is a function on *every* non-terminal state — all syntactically
possible states, including ones no play ever reaches.

This module closes that gap for the general-state presentation. It carves out the
reachable decision sites and proves the extraction is faithful: two choosers
that agree on reachable sites induce the same run law, so behaviour off the
reachable set is genuinely irrelevant rather than merely ignored by convention.

Note the difference from `IsTreeShaped`. There, history *uniqueness* had to be
stated over `Type`-valued traces, because a `Prop`-valued version is vacuous
under proof irrelevance. Here we only ask whether a history *exists*, which is
honestly a `Prop`.
