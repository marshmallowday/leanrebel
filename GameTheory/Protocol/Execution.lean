# Execution protocols

Legal actions, stochastic transitions, terminality, and traces. This layer knows
nothing about who observes what; the information layer sits on top of it.

Three requirements shape the interface.

* **No impossible total chooser.** `Chooser` is asked for a joint action only at
  a *non-terminal* state, so run semantics inspects terminality before
  requesting an action.
* **Chance is carried by the transition law.** A state where nobody is active is
  legal for the no-op joint action, and `step` may still return a nondegenerate
  law. A `none` mover with no probability law is not chance semantics.
* **Histories are data.** `Trace` is `Type`-valued, so `Subsingleton (Trace E s)`
  is a real uniqueness statement. A `Prop`-valued reachability relation would
  make that vacuous under proof irrelevance.

Legality is a definition, not a field: a joint action is legal at a state when
play has not stopped there and every active player supplies an available action.
A protocol therefore cannot declare a legality relation inconsistent with its own
`active` and `available`.

`active` is therefore unconstrained by the execution runner at terminal states:
a protocol may declare somebody active where play has stopped, and execution

terminal activity through `LegalOption`, so model builders must keep terminal
