# Mixed versus pure rationalizability hostile fixture

The row player's third action pays `3/4` against every column.  Neither of the
first two actions purely dominates it, but their half/half mixture pays `1`
against every column. This separates the first mixed-elimination round from
the first pure round. No all-round inclusion between the survivor iterations
is assumed.
