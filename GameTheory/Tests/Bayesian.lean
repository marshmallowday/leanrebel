# Bayesian compiler stress test

One player privately observes a fair bit and must report it. Matching the type
pays one and mismatching pays zero. Truthful reporting is interim-optimal at
both types, hence Nash in the direct form; the exact compiler law then transfers
the same profile to the information-local protocol form. A two-player
common-bit coordination fixture separately exercises both deviation
coordinates of the generic transfer theorem.
