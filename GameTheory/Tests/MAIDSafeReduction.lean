# Safe and unsafe MAID observation reduction

A genuinely fair Boolean signal feeds one Boolean decision.  Removing the
signal is safe when utility rewards the action alone: the always-true reduced
profile covers every full deviation and hence remains Nash after expansion.
With the same diagram and pruning, matching the signal makes the observation
valuable.  Every signal-blind reduced policy earns one half, while the full
copying policy earns one.
