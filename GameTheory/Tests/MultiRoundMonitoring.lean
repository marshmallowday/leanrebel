# Hostile multi-round imperfect-monitoring fixture

Two players act for two rounds.  They observe only whether their actions agree,
so player zero cannot distinguish opponent actions one and two after choosing
zero.  The information state nevertheless remembers player zero's own choice,
and a second-round policy branches on it.
