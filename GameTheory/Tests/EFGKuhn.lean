EFG-facing Kuhn integration test.

The underlying protocol is the existing hostile two-vote model: a player moves
twice, and the perfect-recall signal records which decision is being made and
the action already chosen. Thus local and ex-ante randomization agree for a
substantive reason, not because play has only one decision.
