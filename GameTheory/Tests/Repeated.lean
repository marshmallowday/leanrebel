# Repeated-play boundary stress test

Two players repeatedly choose booleans and receive one exactly when their stage
choices agree. The hostile profile reads the last public stage and flips it, so
the native recursion is genuinely history-dependent. Its three-stage Protocol
execution is exactly the native public prefix. Separately, stationary repetition
of a stage Nash equilibrium is Nash for normalized discounted utility.
