# Groves mechanisms beyond auctions

This public-choice fixture has no bid or winner semantics.  It exercises the
general Groves API on an efficient binary decision, proves truthful reporting
both directly and through the canonical DSIC bridge, and rejects a reversed
allocation rule that is not efficient.
