# The state forgets what the history remembers

A chance move splits play into two branches that the player observes, and the
branches then merge back into one state. At that state the player knows which
branch it came through; the state does not record it.

This is the hostile test for running a game along its history. A chooser indexed
by the state must answer identically at the merged state, whichever branch led
there, so the law it induces is a point mass. A profile of information-local
policies answers differently, because its argument is the history, and its law
puts half its mass on each ending. No state-indexed chooser produces that law,
which is what makes the history runner an extension rather than a restatement.

The same example bounds the claim: nothing here is hidden from the player. What
the state loses is not secrecy but *order* — which of two equally visible pasts
actually happened.
