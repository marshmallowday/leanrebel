# Chance-rooted Zermelo integration witness

Nature first selects a live branch or a terminal branch with equal positive
probability. On the live branch, immediate exit pays `5`, while continuing
reaches a second decision where reward pays `1` and punishment pays `0`.
Backward induction must therefore prescribe exit on path and reward at the
consequential off-path decision. The test exercises chance, global contingent
plans, perfect-information separation, and the public EFG existence theorem.
