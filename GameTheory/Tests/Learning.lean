Discriminating finite trace for no-regret learning.

Two players receive one exactly when their Boolean actions agree. The trace is
coordinated in round zero and mismatched in round one. Player zero therefore
has strictly positive regret in the second round, so the resulting approximate
CCE theorem is not a zero-payoff or already-equilibrium tautology.
