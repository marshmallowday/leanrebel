# Probes for the strategic-form compilation

The state-policy compilation is checked on the coin game from
`GameTheory.Tests.Execution`. The information-local compilation is checked on
the hostile hidden-card model: the compiled law retains both hidden states while
the blind player's strategy is forced by its type to answer them alike. Finally
the repeated-information-state counterexample and the perfect-recall control
check that static mixing agrees with behavioral play exactly where the
compiler's hypotheses say it does.

The hidden-card model is hostile in two directions at once. Nature reaches two
different dealt states with positive probability, and the blind player cannot
distinguish them. The compiled strategy type must preserve both facts.

/-! ## Behavioral play versus static mixing

The static mixed extension draws one whole information-local policy per player.
Behavioral play draws locally during execution. The repeated-information-state
model separates them; the recall model on the same protocol identifies them.
