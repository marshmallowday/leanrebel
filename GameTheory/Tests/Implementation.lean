# Profile-transfer implementation witnesses

Two players initially prefer `false`. Paying two units for choosing `true`
makes the all-true profile uniquely weakly undominated and implements both a
singleton target and a larger cylinder target. Zero transfer leaves the
all-false profile undominated and therefore fails both targets.
