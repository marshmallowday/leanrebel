# Zermelo decision-menu boundary

This one-step protocol has one finite decision menu and an unreachable
information value whose menu is infinite. It is the hostile witness that
backward induction needs finiteness only where a decision can actually occur;
the unavoidable total contingent plan is supplied explicitly as a fallback.
