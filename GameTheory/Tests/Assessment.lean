# Probes for the one-shot-deviation interface

`GameTheory.Protocol.Assessment` reduces the open-game context to two fields and
*derives* local optimality from them. These probes check that the reduction did
not throw away the content.

The failure mode to rule out is a context whose `value` ignores one of its two
fields. Such a `Context` would still satisfy every theorem in the module —
`isLocallyOptimal_iff_no_profitable_deviation` is a tautology about `value`, and
would hold just as well if `value` were constant. So each probe below fixes one
field and varies the other.

/-! ## Probe 5: remaining fuel is coupled to realized depth

The chance-rooted Zermelo fixture contains both a two-decision continuation
and branches that stop early.  At horizon three, its first decision has one
continuation step left, its second decision has none, and an early exit is
absorbing for the unused final unit of fuel.  This is the stopping shape that
the former depth-independent one-shot premise failed to distinguish. -/

/-! ## Probe 6: information-local one-shot optimality reaches compiled Nash

The repeated-vote information model is hostile to a merely initial-history
argument: the same player can be at either of two nonterminal histories, and
the one-shot premise must cover both. At horizon one, always voting up is
locally optimal at every such history when utility rewards the vote just made.
The generic bridge then controls every replacement policy and proves ordinary
Nash in the compiled `GameForm`.
