Hostile correlated-dominance fixture.

Against player one's surviving action `false`, player zero's `true` strictly
dominates `false`.  The dominance is deliberately only relative: when player
one plays the eliminated action `true`, the comparison reverses.  The pure
Nash/CE law at `(true, false)` therefore exercises support-aware dominance
without accidentally proving global strict dominance.
