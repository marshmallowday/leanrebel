# Nested MAID observation-pruning composition

One decision originally observes two Boolean signals.  The coarse pruning
retains the first signal, while the fine pruning retains neither.  Action
reward validates nested deviation coverage and preference orientation.  A
nearby signal-matching payoff makes the first pruning step unsafe while the
coarse-to-full step remains safe.  No graphical or recall claim is made.
