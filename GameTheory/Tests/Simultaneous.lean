# The simultaneous-action slice

The measurement that runs *against* the finite-first presentation. It needs no
certificates where the general-state protocol needs two plus an extraction
construction, so this is the axis where the comparison reverses.

The general-state protocol has several players active at one state and a `step`
that consumes a joint action, so simultaneity is native. The finite-first
`Tree.node` carries a single `mover`, so the only way to encode the same game is
to sequentialize it — and this file proves that sequentializing is not
faithful: it strictly enlarges the strategy space, because the second mover's
contingent plan gets to depend on the first mover's action.

That is the classical reason a game tree needs information sets before it can
represent a simultaneous move. Here it is a theorem about strategy counts.
