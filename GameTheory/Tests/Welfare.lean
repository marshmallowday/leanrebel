# Individual-rationality hostile fixture

The low profile produces outcome `false`.  The improved profile produces a
fair non-point-mass law.  Player `false` moves from utility one to expected
utility two, while player `true` remains at one.  This exercises weak Pareto
improvement, nonzero unequal reservations, pointwise suprema, and rejection of
an excessive outside option without introducing another payoff semantics.
