# Hostile information tests

A strategy that could see hidden execution state at an information set, or a
locality claim resting on a proposition proved after the fact, would defeat the
purpose of the information layer. These are the tests that would catch either.

The protocol below is the standard validation case: an imperfect-information
game with two execution states in one information set. Nature deals a card; the
`informed` seat is privately told which card it is, the `blind` seat is not; both
then call a card simultaneously, and the terminal state records the truth and
both calls.

Four things make it hostile rather than decorative.

* The two dealt states are genuinely different states with different
  continuations — the terminal state remembers which card was dealt — yet the
  blind seat's information state is the *same value* at both. So `congrArg` is
  enough to make every blind policy answer them identically
  (`every_blind_policy_agrees`). Nothing asserts constancy; the policy type has
  no state argument to vary.
* The same protocol contains a seat that *can* tell the two states apart, so
  equality of the blind seat's information states is real content and not the
  degeneracy of an `InfoState` like `Unit` that would make every such equation
  true. That is `informed_can_tell`, and it is the probe the whole file rests
  on.
* Three further probes rule out cheaper degeneracies: the blind seat's own call
  reaches its information state (`blind_remembers_own_call`, so `pushInfo`'s
  action argument is load-bearing), its information state moves when the deal is
  announced (`blind_sees_the_deal`, so it is not constant along a history), and
  the two merged states have different futures (`hidden_card_matters`). The menu
  is not `Set.univ` either: at the calling phase the blind seat must name a card
  and may not pass. Finally `blindPolicy` inhabits the policy type, so the
  `∀ policy` statements are not quantifying over nothing.
* Beliefs and legality are checked at the information *set*: a uniform posterior
  over the two dealt states is supported on it, and every blind policy's call is
  legal at both states — while the policy never received either.

`blind_policy_type` is the structural test: the public policy type is stated as
a `rfl`-checked type equation in which `hiddenCard.State` does not appear.

/-! ## Structural test: the policy type has no execution state

For *any* protocol and model, a policy is a function of the information state
and its menu. A policy that reads `E.State` is not this type, so a non-local
strategy is not merely unused — it cannot be written. -/

example {ι : Type} {E : ExecutionProtocol ι} (M : InformationModel E) (i : ι) :
    M.Policy i =
      ((info : M.InfoState i) →
