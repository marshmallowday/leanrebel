# Hostile MAID observation-pruning witness

A chance signal is an observed parent of one decision.  Pruning removes that
input from the reduced policy domain. Constant policies factor through the
smaller domain and keep their native/compiled assignment law; a signal-reading
full policy is proved outside the image of every reduced policy.
