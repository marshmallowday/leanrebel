# Unilateral Kuhn and Nash-transfer witness

Two players move sequentially and the terminal history records both Boolean
actions.  Public state information gives perfect recall.  The fixture keeps a
genuine nondeviator in the law when the other player's strategy is converted,
then attaches coordination utility for the Nash-transfer consumer.
