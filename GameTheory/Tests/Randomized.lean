# Where a player puts its randomness

The same player moves twice and cannot tell the two occasions apart: it observes
only whether play has stopped. That is enough to separate the two ways of
randomizing.

A behavioral policy draws afresh each time it is consulted, so it can play one
action and then the other. A mixed policy draws a whole deterministic policy
once, and that policy answers the one information state the one way, so the two
moves must agree. The laws therefore differ, and the difference is exactly a
pair of unequal moves.

This is why an equivalence between the two randomizations has to assume that
play never returns a player to an information state it has already acted at. The
protocol here is the smallest thing that violates that assumption, so it records
what such a hypothesis is buying.
