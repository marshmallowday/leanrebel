# Zero-sum games and saddle points

When the players' payoffs sum to zero at every outcome there is only one number
to track, and an equilibrium becomes a *saddle point*: the first player cannot
push it up alone and the second cannot push it down alone.

Nothing here needs a fixed point. The definitions are static, the equilibrium
correspondence is arithmetic, and the fact that all saddle points of a game are
worth the same is a two-line argument from the definition. Only the assertion
that one exists needs analysis, and it lives above this module rather than in
it.

The two-player restriction is real and is in the type: the saddle inequalities
name a player who moves up and a player who moves down, and with three players
there is no such pair.
