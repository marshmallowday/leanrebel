# Potential games

A potential is a single real function on profiles that every player's incentives
follow. It buys the one thing a general game does not have: a reason for a pure
equilibrium to exist at all, with no fixed-point theorem and no topology —
maximize the potential and nobody can gain by moving alone.

Two strengths are recorded, because the existence argument needs only the weaker
one. An *exact* potential moves by exactly as much as the deviator's expected
utility; an *ordinal* potential only has to move in the same direction. The
first implies the second, and the equilibrium-existence family is proved at
the ordinal level.

/-! ## A family that always has one

A potential constrains only *unilateral* changes, so it says nothing about
coalitions and nothing about efficiency: the maximizer is an equilibrium, not
necessarily the profile the players would agree on. What it does supply is
existence, and one natural family supplies the potential for free. -/

/-- **Identical interests are a potential game**, with the common payoff as the
potential. Nothing is computed: when every player values an outcome the same, the
deviator's change *is* the potential's change. -/

/-! ## Local optima and improvement dynamics

The potential argument has two useful dynamic readings.  First, Nash profiles
are precisely the local potential maxima.  Second, a unilateral strict utility
improvement is a directed edge on profiles; finiteness turns an ordinal
potential into a well-founded ranking of those edges.  These are semantic
relations, rather than an executable better-response scheduler. -/

potential under unilateral replacements. -/
