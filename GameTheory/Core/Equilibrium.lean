# The standard equilibrium concepts

Every concept in this file is a choice of status quo and deviation scheme for
the single predicate `IsEquilibrium`. None of them is a new logical definition,
and none of them mentions expected utility: the preference stays an explicit
argument.

| Concept | Status quo | Units | Deviations |
|---|---|---|---|
| pure Nash | `pure σ` | players | constant unilateral replacements |
| mixed Nash | `pure σ` in `F.mixed` | players | replacement mixed strategies |
| CCE | arbitrary profile law | players | constant unilateral replacements |
| CE | arbitrary profile law | players | recommendation-dependent maps |
| strong Nash | `pure σ` | nonempty coalitions | joint member replacements |

Mixed Nash is `IsNash F.mixed`, not a separate predicate.

/-! ## Nash sits inside the correlated hierarchy

A pure equilibrium is a correlated equilibrium of its own point mass. Unlike the
coarse case this is not definitional — a correlated deviation may read the
recommendation — but at a point mass there is only one recommendation to read. -/

/-! ## The correlated concepts are convex

Nash equilibria are not closed under mixing — mixing two of them correlates the
players, which is exactly what a Nash profile may not do. The correlated
concepts are, and the reason is visible in their shape: both compare a `bind` of
the status quo against another `bind` of the same status quo, and composition is
affine in the law it composes with.

Convexity of the preference is a hypothesis rather than a fact about weak
preferences; expected utility satisfies it. -/
