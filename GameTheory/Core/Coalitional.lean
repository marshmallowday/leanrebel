# Coalitional games and the core

A coalitional game says what each group can guarantee itself and says nothing
about how. There are no strategies, no play, and no outcome carrier, so this is
deliberately *not* a `GameForm`: forcing it into one would require inventing a
strategy space nobody uses and an outcome nobody observes.

What is shared is the vocabulary of groups. A coalition is a `Finset Agent`
here for the same reason it is one in a strong equilibrium's deviation, and the
core's condition has the same shape as that deviation's — a group objects when
it can do better by itself.

The two theorems below are a possibility and an impossibility. Core allocations
are individually rational, which follows from the definition with nothing
assumed; and the three-player majority game has no core allocation at all,
which is why cooperative solution concepts other than the core exist.
