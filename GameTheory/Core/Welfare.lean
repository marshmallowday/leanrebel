# Social welfare and smooth games

Social welfare is an aggregate view of the canonical expected utilities, not a
new game or payoff semantics.  Smoothness likewise quantifies over unilateral
updates in the existing game form.  Its first consumer is the affine
congestion-game price-of-anarchy theorem.

The public surface intentionally stops at an inequality.  It does not define
an optimum, a best or worst equilibrium, or a total-division ratio whose
meaning changes at zero or under the cost-to-welfare sign convention.
