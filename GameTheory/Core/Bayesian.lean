# Finite Bayesian game forms

A common-prior Bayesian game has two static presentations: realized actions and
type-contingent plans. This module owns only that data and its direct
`GameForm`; utility and equilibrium theory live in `BayesianEquilibrium`, so a
language compiler may reuse the syntax without importing solution concepts.

Finiteness is deliberately absent from the structure. The common prior already
has finite support, while enumerating every value of one player's type is a
capability needed only by the interim decomposition theorem.
