# Finite Bayes-correlated equilibrium

A direct recommendation law jointly distributes true type profiles and
recommended action profiles. It is Bayes plausible when its type marginal is
the common prior, and obedient when no player gains from a deviation depending
only on that player's own type and recommendation.

The main theorem pushes a Bayes-Nash plan from a finite private-signal
information structure to an obedient recommendation law in the original game.
Bayes-Nash remains ordinary `IsNash` of the induced Bayesian game form.

Bayes plausibility plus every positive own-type/recommendation cell preferring
obedience to a fixed replacement is equivalent to the existing ex-ante
deviation-map definition.

The reverse implication disintegrates the recommendation law by the observed
pair.  Consequently the result needs neither all-player type finiteness nor an
additional posterior representation. -/
