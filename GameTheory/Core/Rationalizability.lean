# Correlated and independent rationalizability

For finite games, correlated rationalizability admits an iterated-deletion
characterization: eliminate a pure strategy when a finite mixture of surviving
own strategies strictly improves against every surviving joint opponents'
profile.  Unlike Bernheim--Pearce independent rationalizability for games with
three or more players, this characterization does not impose a product-belief
restriction across opponents.

The correlated mixture and every independent marginal use the canonical
`FinDist`; no second profile, probability, or equilibrium layer is introduced.
Pure-strategy elimination remains the separately named `pureSurvivors` /
`SurvivesAllPureEliminationRounds` surface in `Core.Response`.
