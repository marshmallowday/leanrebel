# The mixed extension and its equilibria

Mixed Nash is not a new predicate: it is `IsNash` of the mixed extension, and the
whole point of `GameForm.mixed` is that no second solution concept is needed. The
facts below are what make that presentation usable.

The first is that pure equilibria survive the embedding, which is not automatic —
a pure equilibrium resists only pure deviations, and the mixed game offers a law
over them. What closes the gap is that the deviator's expected utility is the
*average* of the pure deviations' utilities, so nothing beats a bound that every
pure deviation already respects.

That step is stated for expected utility rather than for an arbitrary weak
preference, and deliberately: a preference that does not respect averaging has no
reason to survive the embedding, and nothing in a `WeakPreference` makes it do
so.

/-! ## What a mixed equilibrium randomizes over

A mixed equilibrium does not merely fail to gain by deviating; it is indifferent
across everything it actually plays. That is the fact every computation with
mixed equilibria uses, and it is a consequence rather than a definition. -/

its own randomization. -/
