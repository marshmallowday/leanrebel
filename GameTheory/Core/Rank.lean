# Rankings and relation laws

This is the probability-free preference vocabulary. A `Ranking` is merely one
explicit comparison per agent; reflexivity, transitivity, totality, and
antisymmetry are named hypotheses rather than typeclass instances or stored
fields. `Preference` lifts the same laws pointwise to a family of rankings.

Lottery-specific preferences import this module, not conversely. That physical
direction keeps social choice independent of probability as well as
mathematically unrelated to it.
