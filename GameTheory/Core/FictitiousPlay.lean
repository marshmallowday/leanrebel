# Fictitious-play trajectories

Fictitious play repeatedly chooses a pure best response to the independent
empirical marginals of past play.  This file owns the topology-free state and
recurrence.  Claims about limits of these beliefs live in the analytic
consumer; the core interface itself is just finite-support probability and the
canonical best-response predicate.

by Fictitious Play,” in T. C. Koopmans (ed.), *Activity Analysis of Production
and Allocation*, Cowles Commission Monograph 13 (1951), 374--376.
