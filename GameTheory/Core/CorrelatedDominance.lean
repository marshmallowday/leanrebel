# Correlation and strict dominance

Correlated equilibrium has an operational reading after a recommendation is
observed: conditional on receiving an action of positive probability, obeying
is at least as good as replacing it.  That conditional statement is the bridge
from correlation to the canonical relative-dominance predicate in `Response`.

The results are specialized to expected utility.  They introduce neither a
second equilibrium predicate nor a second conditioning interface, and they do
not require finite strategy carriers.

/-- For expected utility, correlated equilibrium is exactly obedience after
each recommendation that can actually be observed.  Recommendations outside
the law's support impose no condition.

The reverse implication disintegrates the law by the deviator's observed
recommendation.  Thus the local replacement checks jointly cover an arbitrary
recommendation-dependent response without requiring the strategy type itself
to be finite. -/
