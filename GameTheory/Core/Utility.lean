# Utility evaluation and expected-utility preference

Utility is separate data from the game form. `euPreference` is a *derived*
weak preference, so every equilibrium concept keeps exactly one logical
definition: `IsNash F (euPreference u) σ` is expected-utility Nash, and there is
no second predicate to rewrite between.

Expected utility stays specialized to `ℝ`. The executable frontend evaluates
rational payoffs and connects to this layer by a proved compilation, not by a
scalar parameter threaded through the core.

cannot beat all of them. This is why the standard equilibrium concepts may be
defined with deterministic deviations without weakening them. -/
