# EXP-104: global Markov with impossible evidence

This hostile consumer runs finite global-Markov soundness through a separated
three-node chain whose middle node is deterministically false.  The theorem is
then instantiated at the unsupported evidence configuration `middle = true`.
The result uses the division-free cylinder cross-product directly and requires
neither evidence positivity nor a conditional-law convention at zero mass.
