# A three-node MAID on the shared execution base

The encoding that argues hardest against a
single execution interface. A multi-agent influence diagram is not a state
machine: it is a DAG of chance, decision, and utility nodes, each reading its
parents, with no notion of a state, a step, a run, or a terminal position.
The question is whether that shape compiles into `ExecutionProtocol` and
`InformationModel` *honestly*, because the shared execution base is worthless if the
encoding needs fake players, fake actions beyond the canonical `noop`, or
language-specific escape fields.

The diagram is the smallest interesting one: one chance node (`forecast`), one decision node
(`plan`) whose only parent is the chance node, and one utility node (`payoff`)
reading both. It carries two agents rather than one, because a *multi*-agent
influence diagram in which one agent's decision determines another agent's
utility is the smallest thing worth calling a MAID: `planner` owns the decision
node, `sponsor` owns the utility node and never acts.

Four results decide the experiment.

* `runFor_eq_intendedOutcome` — the compiled run law is exactly the diagram's
  intended outcome law, written from the syntax alone: draw the chance node,
  apply the decision rule to the parent it observes, evaluate the utility
  table. `expect_payoffValue_runFor` turns that into the MAID's expected-utility
  semantics.
* `act_eq_some_ruleOf` and `chooserOf_eq_jointAt` — a MAID decision rule *is*
  an information-local policy, and running the compiled protocol with the
  reconstructed chooser is running those policies.
* The discriminating probes `outcome_law_depends_on_decision` and
  `outcome_law_depends_on_observation` — two policies induce different outcome
  laws, and a policy that reads the parent beats every constant one. Without
  them the theorems above would be satisfied by an encoding that quietly
  resolved the decision node itself.
* The `## Workarounds` section, which is the actual deliverable: an unsparing
  list of every language-specific concession, each backed by a theorem where a
  theorem is possible.

Read that section before concluding anything from the theorems.

/-! ## Native syntax

The diagram's skeleton is fixed — three nodes, one edge set — so this is a
concrete MAID and deliberately not a DAG framework. -/

/-- The agents of the diagram. `planner` owns the only decision node; `sponsor`
owns the only utility node and never acts. There is deliberately no `nature`
constructor: chance is not an agent in a MAID, and adding one here would be
exactly the fake player a dishonest encoding would introduce. -/

/-! ## The discriminating probes

Everything above would still be provable by an encoding that resolved the
decision node itself and ignored the policy — the outcome law would then be the
same for every policy, and `runFor_eq_intendedOutcome` would hold vacuously
because `ruleOf` would also be reading a value nobody used. These probes rule
that out. -/

/-- **Probe 1.** The compiled run law depends on the decision node's value: two
policies give two different outcome laws. The decision has not been collapsed
away. -/
theorem outcome_law_depends_on_decision :

  rw [expect_constant_indoors, expect_constant_outdoors] at hscore

/-- **Probe 2.** The decision node's *observation* is load-bearing too: a rule
that reads the parent achieves an expected utility no constant rule achieves,
so the compiled information state is not decorative. -/

execution state in disguise. -/

/-! ## Workarounds

Every language-specific concession the encoding needed, with a theorem attached
wherever one is possible. The three failures worth ruling out are fake players,
fake actions beyond the canonical no-op, and escape fields; the first three
entries answer them, and the rest are the honest remainder.

**1. Fake players: none.** The protocol's index type is `Agent`, which is the
diagram's own agent set. Chance is carried by the transition law at an
ownerless node (`owner_forecast`, `chanceLaw_init`), so no `nature` index
exists. `no_extra_agent` records that `Agent` has no third constructor.

**2. Fake actions beyond the canonical no-op: none.** `actionOf` gives the
planner exactly its decision node's alphabet and gives the sponsor `Empty`
(`sponsor_action_is_empty`); an agent with no decision node needed no padding
action, and `sponsorPolicy` is still a policy. At both non-decision nodes the
only legal joint action is `E.noop` (`legal_eq_noop_of_pending_ne_plan`), and
`transition` has no branch that invents an outcome for an illegal joint action:
the decision branch reads the planner's action out of the legality certificate
via `decisionValue`, and the exhausted-diagram branch is discharged by the
certificate's non-terminality conjunct. This cost a dependent match on the
certificate. Writing a `none` branch at the decision node and a self-loop at the
terminal state would be shorter, but both would invent an outcome for a joint
action that legality already excludes.

**3. Language-specific escape fields: none.** `ExecutionProtocol`,
`InfoSignals`, and `InformationModel` were used as declared. No field of
`Diagram` exists to satisfy the compiler except `planNonempty` — see 4.

**4. One well-formedness obligation the syntax did not state.**
`Diagram.planNonempty` exists because `ExecutionProtocol.progress` demands a
legal joint action at every non-terminal state, and an active agent with an
empty alphabet has none. This is a true statement about MAIDs that native
syntax leaves implicit, not an encoding artifact — but the encoding is what
forced it to be written down.

**5. The DAG had to be linearized, and the state space is its prefixes.**
`Stage` has four constructors for three nodes: one per prefix of the
topological order, including the empty prefix, which is `init`. The extra state
is unavoidable — `ExecutionProtocol` has a single `init` and chance must be
stepped *into*. For this diagram the topological order is unique, so nothing
was chosen arbitrarily. A MAID with two incomparable decision nodes would need
an arbitrary interleaving, and the compiled protocol would then assert an order
the diagram does not have. **That case is not tested here, and it is the one
place this experiment does not license a general claim.**

**6. The utility node costs an execution step, and `IsChance` cannot see the
difference.** The utility node is resolved by a no-op step whose law is a point
mass (`chanceLaw_planChosen`), so `planChosen_isChance` holds even though the
diagram has no chance there. `ExecutionProtocol.IsChance` means "play continues
and nobody acts", which conflates a chance node with a deterministic
administrative step. Nothing breaks, but a MAID's node kinds are not
recoverable from the protocol; only the law tells them apart. The run therefore
needs one unit of fuel per node, not per decision.

**7. The protocol has no payoff, so utility is an observable.** `Stage.resolved`
stores a real number and `Stage.payoffValue` reads it, with a default of zero
off the support. This is the intended layering — utilities live in `Core` — but
it means the compiled state carries a value that no execution rule ever
inspects, and it costs the state space its decidable equality.

**8. `runFor` is state-indexed; policies are history-indexed.** `chooserOf`
bridges the gap by reconstructing the planner's view from the stage
(`viewOf`). That is sound here only because the stage records the value of
every resolved node, which is why this diagram also satisfies the *state*-level
menu adequacy `menuAt_adequate` that `InformationModel` does not ask for.
`chooserOf_eq_jointAt` proves the bridge gives back exactly the
information-local policies, so no hidden state reaches a decision rule. A MAID
whose decision node did not observe all of its ancestors would still compile,
but its chooser could not be reconstructed this way.

**9. `pushView` is memoryless, and that is diagram-specific.** The private
signal recomputes the observed parent's value from the target state at every
step, so the information state never has to accumulate. With two decision nodes
and a non-observing second one, `pushInfo` would have to remember, and
`infoOf_eq_viewOf` would fail — as it should, since the information state would
no longer be a function of the state.

**10. The public signal is an addition to the syntax.** `InformationModel.menu`
ranges over `Option (Action i)`, so an information state must determine
*whether* its agent acts. The encoding therefore broadcasts the pending node.
In a MAID the diagram's shape is common knowledge, so this leaks nothing; but
native MAID syntax has no notion of a public signal, and this one exists only
because the menu decides participation. This is the cost the information model
already recorded, arriving here from a second language.

**11. An agent with no decision node still needs information data.** `Whisper`,
`View`, `menuAt`, and `sponsorPolicy` all have a sponsor case, because the
information model is indexed by every agent. All four are trivial — `Unit`,
`Unit`, `{none}`, and the constant `none` — and none of them is a fake action
or a fake player, but the diagram does not contain them: an agent that owns
only a utility node observes nothing and chooses nothing. This is the closest
the encoding comes to padding, and it is padding of the *information* model,
not of the players or the actions.

**Verdict.** MAID shares `ExecutionProtocol` and `InformationModel` honestly on
this slice: entries 1-3 are clean, and none of entries 4-11 is a fake player, a
fake action, or an escape field. Entry 5 bounds the claim: a single-chain MAID
was compiled, and a MAID with incomparable decision nodes has not been. -/
