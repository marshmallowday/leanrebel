# EXP-037: incomparable MAID decisions

This hostile slice tests frontier batching before any general MAID API is made
public. A fair Boolean chance node feeds two Boolean decision nodes owned by
different agents. The decisions are causally incomparable and therefore occur
in one simultaneous Protocol joint-action step. A final administrative step
evaluates utility from both decisions.

The native direct law draws chance, applies both information-local rules, and
evaluates utility. The main theorem proves that the canonical Protocol runner
has exactly that terminal state law.
