# EXP-113: countability of finite protocol histories

Finite traces are countable whenever the state carrier and every action
carrier are countable and the player index is finite.  The encoding below
retains every realized transition, in reverse order, together with the final
state.  The endpoint is included so that the indexed trace can be compared
without introducing transports between state indices.
