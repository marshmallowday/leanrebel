# EXP-107: graphical data for a MAID pruning fixpoint

This experiment keeps the stable MAID syntax unchanged.  It evaluates the
existing exact `UtilityView` against an explicit map of decision-factor
parents.  The edge-addition test restores all original observations at the
queried site at once while leaving every other decision at the candidate
pruning.  This is the hybrid graph used by the addition algorithm, not the
final reduced graph and not a one-edge restoration.

Strategic relevance is separate from requisite observation.  Its graph adds
one local dummy mechanism parent to the source decision and performs the
s-reachability query in the original graph.  The source-to-target orientation
means that the target decision can strategically rely on the source.  No
semantic coverage or equilibrium theorem is claimed here.
