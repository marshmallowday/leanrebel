# EXP-104: finite Bayesian-network cylinder masses

This experiment connects the local factor algebra to events of a given joint
finite-support law.  Cylinder masses are stated without conditional
probabilities, so impossible evidence remains an ordinary zero-mass case.

The file deliberately assumes a point-mass factorization rather than defining
another Bayesian-network evaluator.  Reverse-topological marginalization is
the next theorem boundary: it must be proved from normalization of the local
kernels before graphical separation can be connected to conditional
independence.
