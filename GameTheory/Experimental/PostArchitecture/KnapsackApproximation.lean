# EXP-056 witness: repaired executable knapsack approximation

The first deliberately hostile input includes an overweight, high-value item.
The second includes a zero-weight item, which the sorter places first and the
greedy scan can never reject for lack of capacity.  The checked frontend needs
only duplicate freedom; every successful result is then a feasible allocation
and is within factor two of the exact explicit-list solver.  This records the
operational boundary without asking the kernel to normalize a sorted
finite-set value.
