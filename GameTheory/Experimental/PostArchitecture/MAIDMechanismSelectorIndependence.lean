# EXP-107: mechanism-selector independence

The exact mechanism graph turns non-s-reachability into division-free
conditional independence between the fair selector and each relevant utility
configuration, conditional on the target's full context and action.  The law
remains the canonical two-component mixture constructed by the factorization
slice.
