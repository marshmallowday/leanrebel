# EXP-105: fixed-policy utility continuation from graphical CI

This file recodes the augmented graph-coordinate conditional independence
theorem into the full-context, target-action, and utility-configuration
observables needed by the canonical finite conditional continuation.  The
result remains about one fixed policy law and makes no replacement-uniformity
claim.
