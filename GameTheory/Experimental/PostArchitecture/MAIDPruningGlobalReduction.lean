# EXP-107: global deviation coverage from sufficient recall

This module closes the semantic pruning argument.  It processes each owner's
decision sites in source-first strategic-relevance order, chooses a reduced
site-optimal rule, and telescopes against an arbitrary full owner deviation.
The induction invariant compares policies that already agree outside the
unprocessed suffix; it does not infer whole-owner optimality from unrelated
sitewise inequalities.
