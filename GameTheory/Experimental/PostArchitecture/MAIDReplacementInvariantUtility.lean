# EXP-105: replacement-invariant utility laws

This module isolates the graph-free distributional seam between utility-leaf
separation and local MAID observation reduction.  Its certificates refer only
to canonical native play under a full owner-policy replacement.  They contain
no reduced replacement witness, preference comparison, or coverage claim.
