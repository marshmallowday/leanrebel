# EXP-104: finite ancestral-moral component partitions

This file turns ancestral-moral separation into explicit finite coordinate
regions and a disjoint partition of ancestral factor indices.  Components not
connected to the first query set are assigned deterministically to the right
region.  The result is purely graph-theoretic; no probabilistic independence
claim is made here.
