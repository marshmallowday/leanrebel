# EXP-105: hostile consumer for graphical MAID reduction

Two distinct utility leaves separate coordination from a signal-only
background payoff.  When the rival ignores the signal, conditioning on the
owner's decision blocks the signal from the coordination leaf.  When the
rival relays the signal, the open route through the rival makes the same
observation requisite and enables a profitable full deviation.
