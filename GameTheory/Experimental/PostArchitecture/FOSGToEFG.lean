# EXP-059: hostile simultaneous stochastic serialization

This file tests one semantic question before any generic bridge is promoted:
can a single-mover EFG serialize a simultaneous stochastic FOSG without
letting a later mover observe an earlier choice?  The target state retains the
full decision prefix so tree shape is real; its information model hides that
prefix until the source transition resolves.
