# EXP-093: executable client transformation adequacy

This hostile slice starts from the executable rational table frontend and ends
in a client-facing game whose heterogeneous actions, player names, and realized
outcomes have all changed.  The sole strategic meaning remains canonical
`IsNash`; the experiment asks whether the existing exact refinement and
transformation theorems compose cleanly enough for an unrelated client.
