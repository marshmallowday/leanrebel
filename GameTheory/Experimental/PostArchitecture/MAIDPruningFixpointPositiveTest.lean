# EXP-107: positive edge-addition-fixpoint consumer

A fair signal precedes two decisions of one owner.  The early decision sees
the signal; the late decision sees both the signal and the early action.  The
candidate removes the signal from both sites but keeps the early-to-late
observation.  Copying the early action at the late site attains the pointwise
maximum utility, so the semantic coverage certificate is proved directly from
canonical play rather than assumed from a future graphical theorem.
