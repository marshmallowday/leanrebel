# Experimental graphical requisite-observation criterion for MAIDs

This experiment leaves the canonical MAID syntax and evaluator unchanged.  A
`UtilityView` enumerates distinct, owner-indexed utility terms and proves that
their additive sum is the owner's canonical utility.
The probabilistic graph uses causal parents at chance nodes and observed
parents at decision nodes: an unobserved ordering predecessor is not thereby a
probabilistic input to a decision rule.

`DConnected` uses the standard ancestral-moral characterization of
d-connection.  Its conditioning argument remains a set throughout.  The
singleton observation criterion says that the observation is *requisite*, in
other words not graphically ignorable, when it remains connected to some
owner-relevant utility term after conditioning on the decision and every
other observation.

No semantic soundness theorem is asserted here.  In particular, graphical
non-requisiteness cannot force an arbitrary policy to ignore an input; the
later semantic theorem must construct an equally good factoring policy or
take factorization as a hypothesis.

/-! ## Same utility, split leaves versus one merged leaf

The next control is the reason utility terms must remain distinct.  Both views
prove exactly the same canonical utility.  In the split view, the signal-only
term is not a descendant of the decision and the reward-only term is separated
from the signal by the conditioned decision.  Merging the two summands into one
leaf instead makes the signal a parent of a decision-relevant utility leaf.
That merged graph therefore classifies the signal as requisite.
