# Historical two-round simultaneity architecture witness

The multi-round counterpart of the one-shot simultaneous test. One round of
simultaneous moves is enough to show that a single-mover tree cannot express
simultaneity; this file checks the harder claim, that simultaneity *composes*
across rounds without encoding tricks.

Everything the encoding needs is already in the execution interface: `active` is
a predicate over players, so a whole round is one state; `step` consumes a joint
action, so a round resolves in one transition; and the resulting state carries
the round's outcome forward, so the second round can depend on the first.

The probes below are what make that claim non-vacuous. Each fixes everything
but one thing and varies it: both players' first-round calls matter, the second
round is not vestigial, and the state reached after round one genuinely records
which outcome occurred.

/-! ## Workarounds

The list this encoding is obliged to produce.

**Fake players: none.** The index type is the game's own player set, and every
non-terminal state has all of them on move.

**Fake actions beyond the canonical no-op: none.** Both rounds use the players'
real action carrier. The no-op never appears, because no state has an idle
player: `all_active_of_not_terminal` says everybody moves wherever play
continues.

**Escape fields: none.** The execution interface was used as declared.

**The honest remainder.** The middle state carries the first round's outcome
rather than the first round's *actions*. That is a modelling choice, not a
workaround — but it means a game whose second round depends on the exact
first-round profile, not just on its summary, would need a wider state. Nothing
in the interface prevents that; this file simply does not test it.

No information model is built here. Round two conditioning is expressed through
the state, which is the perfect-monitoring case; the imperfect-information
overlay is exercised elsewhere, on a protocol built for it.
