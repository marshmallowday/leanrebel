# EXP-104: dependent coordinate cylinders

This file specializes the experiment's single finite-law conditional-
independence predicate to typed MAID assignments.  Coordinates are observed by
`Assignment.restrict`; no second conditional-independence notion is introduced.

Cylinder statements retain complete dependent `Config` values.  In particular,
the same-witness theorem never combines configurations with casts.  A future
graph theorem can impose pairwise-disjoint coordinate sets at its own boundary;
the probability identity itself does not need that assumption.
