# EXP-104: finite Bayesian-network factor scopes

This module isolates the graph-independent seam needed after a moral graph has
partitioned factor scopes.  The graph layer need only show that every factor
assigned to a side has its node and all of its parents in that side's declared
coordinate set.  Coordinate sets may overlap, as they do on conditioning
variables; only the factor-index partition is required to be disjoint.
