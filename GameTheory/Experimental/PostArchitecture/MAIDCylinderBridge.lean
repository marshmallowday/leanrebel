# EXP-104: MAID cylinder bridge

This file identifies the generic dependent-assignment cylinders used by finite
Bayesian-network marginalization with the typed restriction cylinders used by
the MAID coordinate specialization.  It introduces no third event or
conditional-independence notion.

All equalities use one complete witness.  Agreement on a union is equivalent
to agreement of its typed restrictions, without disjointness assumptions or
equality transport in the API.
