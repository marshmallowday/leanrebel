# EXP-008: the Bayesian interim-deviation scope probe

The baseline ex-ante formulation contains no interim deviation: its
`BayesNash` is an `Iff.rfl` wrapper around strategic Nash. Phase 2 therefore
has to produce a genuinely *interim*, type-dependent
deviation test rather than rename the ex-ante theorem.

This is a scope probe, not a public API. It answers one question: does an
interim deviation fit the shared local-deviation interface without exposing
another player's type or recommendation?

The answer recorded by `isNash_iff_interim` below is yes, in the following
precise sense.

* A Bayesian game compiles to an ordinary `GameForm` whose strategies are
  type-contingent plans. Ex-ante Bayes-Nash is then `IsNash` of that form under
  `euPreference` — no new predicate.
* `interimValue` takes the deviator's *own* type and *own* action and nothing
  else. Another player's type appears nowhere in its argument list.
* Ex-ante optimality is equivalent to interim optimality at every own-type.
  That equivalence is a theorem with content, not a definitional unfolding: it
  needs the prior to decompose over the deviator's own type, and it needs the
  ex-ante deviation to be reconstructible from a single-type change.

The probe deliberately uses the prior-weighted (unnormalized) interim value, so
no positive-probability side condition is needed and no conditioning machinery
enters the core.
