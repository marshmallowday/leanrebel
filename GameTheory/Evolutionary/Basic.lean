# Static evolutionary stability

ESS and NSS are properties of a homogeneous two-argument payoff kernel. The
strategy carrier may contain pure actions, mixed population strategies, or
another explicitly chosen phenotype; the generic definition does not silently
choose among them. No population state, dynamics, finite carrier, topology, or
game form is part of the definition.
